Two stories I was just dying to repost today which I discovered on <a href="http://www.planetizen.com/" target="_blank">planetizen</a>! The first one being that IKEA are moving into the world of Urban Design with plans to create a new neighborhood in East London, without an IKEA store in sight! And two a genius tool has been developed by the plucky germans to to let Urban Planners Visualize Traffic, Noise, And Pollution.

<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/welcome-to-ikea-land-furniture-giant-begins-urban-planning-project/article2388705/singlepage/#articlecontent" target="_blank">According to the Global Mail when complete the development will resemble</a>:

> &#8230;a reproduction of the sort of historic, chic downtown neighbourhoods you find in the far more central parts of London or Paris, not in this distant expanse of former dockyards and bloodless public-housing project. At its core are straight, car-free streets lined with simple townhouses and ground-floor-access flats in five-storey rows. In the alleyways behind – an imitation of the classic London backstreet, the mews – will be little two- and three-storey homes, all with direct access to the street.

An interesting concept I think, lets hope they don&#8217;t approach the built environment with the same mad dash for the sameness of IKEA furniture and they create something awesome to behold! If you take a gander at the promotional website and image below, it looks pretty sweet. It would also appear that there will be very little car access to the site too which is pretty sweet. **(Click the image to explore the masterplan for the development)**

## Visualize traffic impacts &#8211; thanks to the germans

The other article is this incredibly cool visualization tool for ArcGIS to allow planners like us to visually see the impacts the increasing in traffic a new development may have! <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679613/a-3-d-tool-to-let-urban-planners-visualize-traffic-noise-and-pollution" target="_blank">Pop on over to Fast.co Design to marvel at it!</a>

> No more guessing about what the impact of improvements to cities might be. Now urban planners have software to fully visualize what will happen when projects become reality.
