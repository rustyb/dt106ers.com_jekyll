[An article in the Irish Times today][1] (truncated article below) detailed the troubles faced by Oxigen and the intended refusal of the waste license for it&#8217;s Corranure site by the [Environmental Protection Authority (EPA)][2]. One would wonder when is the Minister going to make a decision and grant the foreshore license for the incinerator in Dublin and we can be done with the majority of the cities waste being moved outside of the Greater Dublin Area Region?

Maybe for the council it might be worth looking at the contract and supplying the incinerator due to become operational at Carranstown in Meath later this year. It&#8217;s been granted a license to dispose of 150,000 tonnes of waster a year. The facility is owned and to be operated by [Indaver Ireland.][3]

One final question I would really like to know the answer to is when will the Minister grant permission for foreshore license so construction on the Poolbeg waste to energy plant can get under way!? Also why not deal with the waste at source and not truck it all the way to Meath and get on with building the incinerator at Poolbeg?

> SOME 25,000 tonnes of Dublin's household waste is to be sent to landfill sites in Louth and Offaly following the closure of a Cavan dump operated by private waste company Oxigen.
> 
> The company has decided to close its operations at the landfill in Corranure, Co Cavan, four months after being awarded a contract by Dublin County Council to dispose of the capital's household waste at the site.
> 
> Landfill operations will cease within the next month. Dublin City Council said it understands the waste will instead go to landfill sites at Whiteriver, Dundalk, Co Louth, and Derryclure in Tullamore, Co Offaly.
> 
> The decision has been taken following signals from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) it intended to refuse a licence for the operation of the Corranure site.
> 
> The city council last November awarded contracts to Oxigen and Bord na Móna, worth about €10 million, to take almost 150,000 tonnes of Dublin waste following the closure of Arthurstown, the last municipal landfill serving the region. The Arthurstown landfill, the dump used for most of Dublin's waste, was about 4km over the county border with Kildare, but was owned and operated by South Dublin County Council.
> 
> Dublin City Council had anticipated the end of the capital's landfill capacity for more than a decade but had envisaged that the Poolbeg incinerator would be up and running by now. Work on the incinerator began in December 2009, but has been suspended since last May.
