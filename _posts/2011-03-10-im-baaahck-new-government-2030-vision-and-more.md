Well I&#8217;m back! It has been way too long since I wrote on this here blog, mainly down to my downright laziness and well hey sometimes you have to do some work in college! As Enda Kenny said:

> It&#8217;s a new dawn for Irish Politics

Well so far that has meant we have a Minister for Children, departments have been amalgamated and such. But more importantly Planning and Housing has been made a super junior minister portfolio, whatever that means? Is spatial planning going to be taken seriously and elevated to the cabinet table all of the time? A friend of mine reckons what the Super means is:

But enough of that! Willie Penrose TD (Labour) is our new Super Junior Minister for Housing and Planning, who is this guy you might ask? I had no idea until yesterday. You might also ask what does this guy look like? Well there you have him in all his Labour glory on the left.

#### <img class="alignleft" title="Willie Penrose TD" src="http://www.labour.ie/common/images/people_new/240x160_williepenrose.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /> Quick Bio:

He is sitting TD for Longford / Westmeath and is Labour spokesperson on Enterprise Trade and Employment. He recieved [19.8% of 1st preferences in the General Election][1] and went all the way to the 8th count before being elected. A Barrister at law before joining the political circuit, elected to the Dail in 1992 for the first time.  
Info from Wikipedia.org

He replaces our venerable spatial planning colleague @[Ciaran Cuffe][2] as the planning minister, as a barrister will he be preoccupied with the legal issues hanging over the new planning legislation or will he surprise us with some radical spatial thinking? Only time will tell.

### In other News

**[Rail Route Numbers low][4]** &#8211; The Western Rail corridor (the sections complete) are not living up to expectations as set out in the buiness case. Can this be expected considering it&#8217;s not the most useful only being able to go between Limerick and Ennis on an hourly service?

**[Scrapping of N21 Road Plan welcomed][5]** &#8211; This is the news that the new dual carriageway road between Abbeyfeal and Adare has been scrapped due to budgetary constraints. Land development freeze to be lifted along planned route.

**[Government Ban on nuclear energy should be lifted, says expert][6]** &#8211; This is according to Prof Walton, NUI Galway emeritus professor of applied physics. A short but interesting read.

Unrelated to this but will the incinerator go ahead under the new government? For another post i reckon! As always comment are welcome!
