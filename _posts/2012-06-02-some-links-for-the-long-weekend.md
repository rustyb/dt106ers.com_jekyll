To keep you occupied over this ridiculously packed bank holiday weekend I have some links for your viewing pleasure. We kick off with an amazing map produced by the New York Times.

## <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/explorer" target="_blank">NewYorkTimes: Mapping America: Every City, Every Block</a>

Browse local data from the Census Bureau&#8217;s American Community Survey, based on samples from 2005 to 2009. Because these figures are based on samples, they are subject to a margin of error, particularly in places with a low population, and are best regarded as estimates.

## <a href="http://irelandafternama.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/the-nss-and-the-location-of-jobs-in-new-foreign-firms/" target="_blank">IrelandAfterName: The NSS and the location of jobs in new foreign firms</a>

Proinnsias Breathnach and Chris van Egeraat over at Ireland after Nama produce yet another thought provoking article on the suitability of our NSS given the areas where new foreign firms are setting up shop each year in the Ireland.

## <a href="http://www.humantransit.org/2012/05/richard-floridas-supersized-airport-theory.html" target="_blank">Human Transit: richard florida&#8217;s supersized-airport theory</a>

Jarret Walker over at Human Transit yet again promotes my love of both air travel and the transport network (yes, yes! I am a super nerd) with an enlightening piece on how the growth in passenger demand at airline hubs outstrips that of population growth. This is somewhat similar to how nodes at already busy places on the transport network can spur on passenger growth (you listening Dublin Bus?!)
