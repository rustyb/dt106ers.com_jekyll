<span>You may remember this time last year I wrote a post on the future plans that were afoot for a site close to the town of <span>Athlone</span> &#8211; </span><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2010/11/must-read-athlone-to-be-developed-by-the-chinese/" target="_blank">Must Read: Athlone to be developed by the Chinese</a>. Well today I was listening to <a title="RTE Website" href="http://www.rte.ie/radio1/drivetime/" target="_blank"><span>RTE&#8217;s <span>Drivetime</span></span></a><span> while making the dinner, they had a guy on from <span>Athlone</span> Business Park Ltd who are the group behind this project.</span>

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" title="Creggan Site Athlone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-02-at-18.44.52.png" alt="" width="800" height="532" />][1]

<span>Just to refresh the minds this is the development of a 337 hectare site at <span>Creggan</span>, located to the south west of <span>Athlone</span> town, comprising exhibition halls for the use of Chinese manufacturers to trade their wears with European and US trade buyers. The main idea behind it is to cut out the 16 hour trip a US trader would have to make to view manufactured goods in China.</span>

Today they received planning permission from Westmeath County Council which according to RTE:

> <span>A planning application was lodged last May for the first part of what has been dubbed the <span>Athlone</span> Chinatown project. Planning was granted this afternoon to <span>Athlone</span> Business Park Ltd, the company behind the venture, with 47 conditions.</span>

<span>Unfortunately as it&#8217;s late on a Friday the documents have yet to be published on the <span>Westmeath</span> County Council website. You can view the application and its accompanying documents for file no. </span><a title="EPlan File for Creggan" href="http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/ePlan41/FileRefDetails.aspx?file_number=111025&LASiteID=0" target="_blank">111025 Click Here</a>

Interesting times we live in! Will write about the conditions if there is anything wildly outlandish amongst them when they come out. **Will this decision be appealed? **I think you could probably bet your bottom dollar that it will, but that being said there were only 16 submissions made on the file and most appeared to be from local individuals except for the <a href="http://www.nra.ie" target="_blank">National Roads Authority</a>
