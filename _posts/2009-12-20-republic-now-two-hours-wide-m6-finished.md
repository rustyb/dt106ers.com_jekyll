> THE REPUBLIC is now just “two hours wide” with completion of the first “inter-urban” M6 corridor between Galway and Dublin.
> 
> Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey marked the little bit of history yesterday in bright sunshine and freezing temperatures when he formally opened the last section of the 194km motorway in Ballinasloe, Co Galway.
> 
> A speed limit of 120km per hour should cut the journey from the M50 junction to Galway's outer limits to about two hours, according to the National Roads Authority (NRA).  
> <!--more-->
> 
>   
> The final 56km section between Ballinasloe and Galway was completed four months ahead of schedule. However, it was opened unofficially for several weeks last month when it provided the only direct road route from the east during the extensive flooding.
> 
> Mr Dempsey described it as a “major milestone”, while the NRA has billed it as a “historic event”.
> 
> Total cost was €1.1 billion for the entire route, with some €427 million paid by the State and the balance of over €700 million funded through a public-private partnership scheme.
> 
> Motorists will subsidise the PPP element, with a second M6 toll plaza located close to Cappatagle in east Galway in addition to the existing one near Enfield, Co Meath. A round trip through three toll plazas to and from Dublin airport could cost about €15 – the price of a return bus ticket for bus companies now offering a very competitive alternative, if fares are not increased.
> 
> Tolls are now standard on roads across Europe, and the existing old road network between Galway and Dublin remained, Mr Dempsey said. “If you don't want to pay the toll, don't use the motorway,” he told journalists.
> 
> The lack of rest stops – a subject of some criticism – will be addressed, the NRA says. Mr Dempsey said he would be encouraging people to pull off into nearby towns and villages.
> 
> “There is a programme, and as soon as we can afford it we'll put it in place in relation to rest stops,” he said.
> 
> Commenting on the controversy this week over the opening of the M9 Kilcullen-Carlow bypass, Mr Dempsey said that he had been given assurances that it would be open on Monday, and the NRA had said it would be safe to do so. The official opening will take place next month.
> 
> “I don't know what it was all about,” Mr Dempsey said in response to questions about a delay in opening the road to assuage traders' concerns.
> 
> “I was in Brussels. I'm saying no more,” he added, while agreeing that he had been lobbied about the timing of the opening by deputies across all parties. He said it was a matter for the deputies themselves to own up to that.
> 
> The final M6 section was blessed yesterday by Fr Martin McNamara, parish priest of Attymon.
> 
> Galway county manager Martina Moloney said that the route would open up Galway and the west to greater investment.
> 
> Mayor of Ballinasloe Cllr Johnny Walsh (Ind) welcomed the fact that children and the elderly in Ballinasloe would no longer be at risk when crossing the N6 in the town.
> 
> Mr Dempsey has urged all motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to take extra precautions when travelling on our roads during the current cold snap. Met Éireann has forecast wintry showers of sleet and snow to affect parts of Ulster, Connacht, north Leinster and west Munster tonight.
> 
> ROLLOUT WHEN THE MOTORWAYS WILL BE COMPLETED
> 
> THE OPENING of the final section of the M6 makes the Dublin to Galway route the first of the Republic's major inter-urban motorways to be completed.
> 
> Over the coming 12 months, new motorways will open to the regional cities of Waterford, Cork, and Limerick, while the M3 motorway will link the Dublin/ Meath border with the Meath/ Cavan border.
> 
> The timetable for the remaining inter-urban motorways is as follows:
> 
> M3 – 61km of motorway in Co Meath due to open in autumn 2010, but expected earlier.
> 
> M7 – Nenagh to Limerick, 38km, due to open in spring 2010.
> 
> M7 – Limerick Shannon tunnel, 10km, due to open in winter 2010.
> 
> M7 – Castletown to Nenagh, 36km, to open in winter 2010.
> 
> M7/M8 – Portlaoise to Castletown, Portlaoise to Cullahill, 40km, to open winter 2010.
> 
> M9 – Carlow to Knocktopher, 40km, to open winter 2010.
> 
> M9 – Knocktopher to Waterford, 24km, to open spring 2010.
> 
> M50 – improvements in Dublin, completed winter 2010.
