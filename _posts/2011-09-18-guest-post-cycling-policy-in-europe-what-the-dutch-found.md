In 2006, Dutch cycling organisation Fietsberaad commissioned a report into cycling in European cities. The dutch knew their cities have high levels of cycling (for instance almost 40% of all trips undertaken in Groningen are by bike) but wanted to understand how they had got here and if the process could be reproduced in other cities.

The starting place for the report was of course census results. These results gave two bits of interesting, if not expected, results:

1.  Most european cities had high levels of cycling in the 1920-1950s, low levels during the 1960-1970s and since the mid seventies were experiencing a renaissance in numbers. This was true for cities with high levels ( eg Copenhagen) and low levels (eg Manchester) of cycling.
2.  Socio-economic and spatial-economic factors influenced cycling levels. So some socio-economic groups showed a higher tendency towards cycling that others (middle class people cycled more than people on unemployment benefit). Furthermore, spatial-economic factors such as city relief, transport costs and car parking availability were also important.

Keen to further understand the success of cycling in major cities, the report continued on to examine transport and planning policy in key cities. The authors wanted to understand how cities dealt with their specific influencing factors (as derived from analysing census results) and to encourage a modal shift towards cycling.The findings give an good example of why cycling flourishes in some cities. Let&#8217;s take a look at some re-occurring themes.

### A man with a Plan

A mayor, a councillor, or a transport chief with a long term vision of the city. These visionary were able to look at the city transport or layout and assemble a strategy for the future with cycling at the foreground. These men often faced hugh obstacles in pushing through their plans. Businesses and car drivers would often deride the plans to curtail the primacy of the car. However the visionaries stuck firm to their plans and drove through their policies. Or else they put their plans into practice secretly; the transport chief for Copenhagen took a few parking spaces out of the center of Copenhagen every year. Over the course of a decade, whole streets were opened up for cycling lanes where once cars were parked.

### NIMBYism

Picture the scene: you live in the city center, you have kids, you enjoy the lifestyle, you read in the paper one day that the road outside your door is going to be upgraded from a two lane street to a 8 lane motorway. What do you do? Yes, you guessed it, you object. Dutch cities faced this problem in the 1970&#8242;s as they moved from manufacturing, industrial cities, to service-orientated cities. As the factories pulled out, large spaces opened up in the city centers. Council transport departments saw an opportunity to upgrade the road network and improve traffic by building more, or bigger roads. Dutch residents had a different vision. They wanted peaceful, relaxed cities where kids would be safe to play and the air would be clean to breath. Over the course of years, planners began to recognise what sort of cities the residents wanted. A city without cars was productive to a city with bicycles.

### If you build it, they will come

If cycling lanes in Ireland had a theme song, it would probably be the [Talking Heads hit &#8220;Road to Nowhere&#8221;][2]. So many irish towns and cities have cycling lanes that are literally baffling. Dutch transport planners knew that cycling infrastructure had to be top class to entice people to cycle. A strip of paint on a busy open road was always seen as a last resort.

Instead quality cycle lanes,often segregated from the road were built. Furthermore, other key infrastructure, such as covered parking bays was also closely looked at. The responsible authorities listened to cyclists and made changes were possible. Uninterrupted cycle lanes were introduced and fly-overs built to avoid dangerous junctions. The concept of &#8216;kaizen&#8217; (continuous improvement) was also introduced. This resulted in a constant appraisal of the infrastructure and improvements where necessary. Dedicated teams maintained cycle paths and looked for ways to improve the experience of cycling in the city.

### Sex sells

Or so say the advertisers. How can we translate this to cycling policy? Easy, tell people of the bene?ts. Make it look cool. Make it look necessary. Advertising can also kills falsehoods, for instance that cycling is dangerous, or that it always rains. Dutch policy makers were keen to explore this angle and ensure that their investments were not in vain.

## Lesson to be learned

Cycling policy in Ireland lags far behind our european neighbors. While it is full of good intentions, it fails in practice. Cycling levels are among the lowest in Europe. Cycling paths are poor at best, and often added in as an afterthought. Their is hope however. Portland, Oregon experienced a 65% increase in cycling levels between 1990 to 2010. The Irish will cycle again one day if we can get the right people together with the right ideas.
