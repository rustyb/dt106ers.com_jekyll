> A new report presented to Dublin City Council says that retail activity in the city centre has been in decline since April 2008.
> 
> The report was prepared as the local authority decided to review its &#8216;Bus Gate&#8217; traffic management system, which has had a dramatic adverse impact on retail trade in the city centre &#8212; particularly late-night shopping.

In reality, the fall-off on the north side may be worse, because the analysis includes O&#8217;Connell Street which is also a transport hub, so footfall figures may include people who are not shoppers.
> 
> On the south side, the decline is even sharper, at 19 per cent for the same period.
> 
> Thursday night shopping was seriously hit by the Bus Gate system, which banned cars from College Green during the morning and evening rush hours.
> 
> In September this year, footfall on Thursday nights in the Grafton Street area was down 36 per cent compared with September 2008.
> 
> Dublin city councillors have now voted to lift the ban on private cars passing through the area from November 18 to January 15.
> 
> Environment Minister and Green Party leader John Gormleydescribed the decision to temporarily scale back the Bus Gate as &#8220;a retrograde step&#8221;.
> 
> Meanwhile, luxury retailer Brown Thomas has moved to streamline management and administration costs as exceptionally tough conditions continue in the retail sector.
> 
> Under the plan, human resources, information technology and the finance departments of Brown Thomas in Ireland andSelfridges & Co in the UK will be merged.
> 
> The Sunday Independent understands there are no plans for cuts to the &#8220;front of house&#8221; workforce.
> 
> The move to amalgamate back-office services follows the decision by Canadian billionaireGalen Weston to reinstall BT&#8217;s deputy chairman Paul Kelly to head up the Irish operation.
> 
> Former managing director Nigel Blow left the company in September.
> 
> In a statement to the Sunday Independent, Brown Thomas said: &#8220;Following the recent appointment of Paul Kelly, chief executive of Selfridges & Co, as deputy chairman of BrownThomas Group, a review of internal administrative structures has been initiated.
> 
> &#8220;The HR, finance and IT functions for both companies will now be merged to ensure the most efficient alignment of their resources and to take full advantage of the economic recovery when it comes,&#8221; the company added.
