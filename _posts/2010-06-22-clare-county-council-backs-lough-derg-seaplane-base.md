> THE PROMOTERS of a new seaplane service for the west of Ireland were yesterday victorious in their plans to locate a seaplane base on Lough Derg.
> 
> Clare County Council yesterday granted planning permission to Harbour Flights Ireland Ltd for a base at Mountshannon. The decision comes in spite of opposition by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, fishermen and residents.
> 
> As part of the plan the company has lodged four applications before local authorities in Galway, Limerick and Clare to allow it land a seaplane in Lough Derg, the Shannon at Limerick city, Galway city docks and the main harbour serving Inis Mór.

> 
> The director of Harbour Flights Ireland Ltd, Ronan Connolly, yesterday welcomed the council's decision. “After the test flights that we held I believe that the local people are now behind us on the project.”
> 
> He said the objections in the planning process had delayed the plan by six to nine months, and it may not be until next year before scheduled services begin.
> 
> He said the company had applied for an aircraft operating certificate from the Irish Aviation Authority, adding that he hoped there would be a decision on that in the next two months.
> 
> The council gave the plan the go-ahead having regard to its nature and scale, and that it would not seriously injure amenities or property in the area.
> 
> A company report said there would be no significant impacts on local birds and none on fish.
> 
> In an objection by the fisheries board, its chief executive, Eamon Cusack, said “we consider that the presence of birds and the use of airplanes in the area could create a dangerous situation whereby an air accident could arise”.
> 
> “The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is seriously concerned that this development will impact negatively on the fishery and on angling in Lough Derg. The area in this lake is particularly important to trout, pike and other coarse angling.”
