> 
> Councillors met last week to begin the next phase of the preparation of the Plan following on from the initial round of public consultation during the summer.
> 
> Public representatives play an important role at this stage as they provide policy direction to the manager in drawing up the new Plan, which will set out the local authority&#8217;s principle objectives from 2011 to 2017.
> 
> The next key dates are January, February and early March next year when councillors will meet to consider the Manager&#8217;s draft, which will then go on public display.
> 
> Submissions will then be made from the public and councillors will meet to consider making amendments to the plan. County Manager David O&#8217;Connor said some 553 submissions were received from the public in the initial round of consultation, down from over 1,000 from the previous plan. Almost one in five submissions related to transportation issues, followed by concerns about community, recreation and open space. Mr O&#8217;Connor has made four general recommendations in relation to the Plan covering the promotion of sustainable development, minimising climate change, contributing to social inclusion and integrating high quality design to its work.
> 
> It is the aim of the council to realise the long-term Swords Strategic vision and to consolidate the growth of Balbriggan and Blanchardstown.
> 
> It is also the manager&#8217;s aim to consolidate growth and protect the identity of the other town&#8217;s around the region, as well as safeguarding the development of Dublin Airport. Mr O&#8217;Connor said it was estimated that the population was now tipping the quarter of a million mark.

Before the end of the week i hope to have a post written on the development plan process for those who are unsure how it works and also the time limits involved in the action of preparing a new development plan.
