We&#8217;re fast approaching the last week of February, and man it has flown by! It was an interesting week, with plenty of controversy including shock decision by Bord Pleanala to refuse permission for the Children&#8217;s  Hospital on the Mater site.

## The real cost of rural living compared to urban living

<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0225/1224312372125.html#.T0iVMgVk_dY.twitter" target="_blank">Frank McDonald penned an interesting article </a>on how he believes the recent attention surrounding the septic tank charge, is in fact hiding the bigger issue at stake, that urban dwellers are cross subsidizing rural-dwellers.

> Development levies by local authorities reveal a different story. The average levy for a new house in the countryside amounts to €9,300, with no charge for sewerage, whereas the purchase price of a similar-sized house in an urban area would include a much higher levy of €28,650 – of which €5,350 is for sewerage

## New Irish Addresses

I came across a very interesting tweet from Alice Charles of work done by James Nix on the spread of new rural addresses produced between 2005-2007. They&#8217;re really just everywhere! I&#8217;d love to see the new roads overlaid on the new addresses too, certainly presents a different picture to the Ireland you have in your minds eye.

## Geography of Business

Next up is an amazing <a href="http://geographics.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk/2012/02/23/the-evolving-business-geography-of-greater-london/" target="_blank">set of slides from Duncan Smith&#8217;s blog Urban Geographics</a>. They show a general bias of offices conglomeration slightly to the west of central london. Well worth a look as he draws on transport models as a way to draw conclusions as to why some of the clustering has occurred.
