> Fine Gael has called on Dublin City Council to prevent the commencement of construction work on the Poolbeg incinerator over alleged non-compliance with the planning procedure.
> 
> Late last month, an announcement was made by the council that it would start construction of the 600,000 tonne incinerator within weeks, a move then described by Minister for the Environment John Gormley as “most unwise” and “foolhardy”.

> 
>   
> This morning, Fine Gael Councillor Catherine Noone called on Dublin City Council to prevent construction work from commencing on the site.
> 
> She claimed a planning requirement that developers carry out comprehensive reports on wildlife was not fully met.
> 
> “Under the conditions of the planning permission, the developers are required to submit reports for public inspection. The two reports that have not been available are a water fowl survey and a fish diversity survey.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;As a matter of extreme urgency, I am calling on Dublin City Council's planning enforcement department to ensure that construction does not commence because these conditions have not been made&#8221;, she said.
> 
> Ms Noone called on Mr Gormley &#8220;for once and for all to intervene and permanently halt the construction of the Incinerator which is due to commence in a matter of days.”
> 
> Mr Gormley told The Irish Times last month he would introduce a cap on incineration which would limit the facility to burning just half its annual waste capacity.
