As part of our course this year, we have to prepare a masterplan for a client. Our site happens to be beside where the Maynooth Line splits with the Dunboyne Line, and yes trains run every 20 mins on it as far as i could see. It will be nice when the already built railway station gets it&#8217;s access road! Another piece of critical infrastructure under, well part of it at least!
