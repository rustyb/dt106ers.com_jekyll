Movie thursday might have fallen a bit to the wayside in the last few weeks but it&#8217;s back with a bang! First up we have Brendan Finn, who is a wonderful speaker, talking about Bus Rapid Transit and what it could do for your city in this case, Dublin. I first saw Brendan speak when I was doing my thesis at a <a title="Chartered Institute of Logistics &amp; Transport Ireland (CILT)" href="http://cilt.ie/" target="_blank">CILT Event</a>. I was blown away by the work on Buses with a high level of service, it formed quiet a significant part of the assumptions I made during my study as to the levels of service that could be provided on the orbital network.

Brendan makes some key points about Dublin; NAMA will hold a awful lot of sway when it comes to future transit development and Dublin is completely lacking in terms of Orbital services (finally nice to see it recorded in a video!). So I urge you take a few minutes and watch the video below! <a title="Brendan Finn Presentation (SPGN)" href="http://spatialplanning.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Future-Dublin-Forum-Brendan-Finn.pdf" target="_blank">Presentation Slides to follow along with.</a>

## To Norway

A country whose population recently reached that epic figure of 5 million people, which Ireland ain&#8217;t far behind. So keeping the transport theme alive in all its tilt-shift glory, I leave you with Norway a country almost as spread out as Ireland.
