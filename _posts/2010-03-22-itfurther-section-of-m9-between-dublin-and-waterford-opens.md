> ANOTHER MILESTONE in the development of the Republic's motorway network takes place this morning with the opening of the Knocktopher to Waterford section of the M9.
> 
> This new section of motorway allows for improved access to and from the city of Waterford via the new N25 Waterford city bypass at the southern end of the new road.
> 
> The opening leaves just one section, between Knocktopher and Carlow, of the M9 Dublin to Waterford motorway to be completed. This section is on schedule to open by the end of 2010.
> 
> However, the next inter-urban motorway to be completed is expected to be the M8, between Dublin and Cork. The final section of the M8, between Portlaoise and Cullahill, Co Laois, is ahead of schedule and expected to open in the third quarter of this year.
> 
> Today's opening was initially expected some months ago but was delayed by inclement weather conditions.

> The project came in on budget, at €274 million. The new road will link into the Waterford bypass road at Dunkitt, Co Kilkenny, and to the R699 at Knocktopher, also in Co Kilkenny. The road is expected to improve the road safety of, as well as enhance the quality of life for, residents of Knocktopher, Mullinavat and Ballyhale by eliminating through traffic. It is thought it will take about 20 minutes off the journey time between Dublin and Waterford, bringing the driving time to about two hours.
> 
> It will also improve the regional access to Kilkenny via the existing N10 and it is hoped it will act as a catalyst for investment in the southeast region.
> 
> Welcoming the opening, Peter Malone, chairman of the National Roads Authority, said the road would aid tourists in accessing “a full range of offerings from the Irish hospitality industry throughout the southeast”.
> 
> However, Opposition transport spokesman Fergus O'Dowd said Ireland still did not have a 21st century transport network “and now the money has run out”.
> 
> He said much of the Department of Transport's responsibility had been devolved “to State agencies and quangos”, leaving the Minister for Transport with little more than a ceremonial role.
