This is a little off topic from my usual but i thought it would be important to show off some of the urban art and extra little features of urban design which some of europes great cities had to offer me while i leisurely toured by train around europe this summer.

Only the classiest graffiti can be found around the Pantheon, but yet it still just works.

[<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5027098447_43b21574cb.jpg" alt="Paris" width="500" height="334" />][23]

On a final note I ask why can&#8217;t the graffiti in Ireland be as good as some shown above? Maybe we need to move forward to a public perception that not all spray painting is bad and maybe encourage the talents in the community to create some master pieces on the sides and fronts of our public buildings and brighten up someones day. All we want is colour, even if it is only for those winter months!

More pictures will follow as i slowly get the courage to dissect the masses of photos taken on a 4 week trip. Stay tuned!
