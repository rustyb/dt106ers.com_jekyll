We are in a new year, there hasn&#8217;t been any crazy biblical natural disaster wiping thousands off the earth yet, so a good year so far. To start on another good note, [dt106ers.com][2] is over a year old and in the last year from 2nd january 2010 &#8211; 2nd january 2011 6, 649 people unique people visited the site, some these (most) were more than likely spam bots, but who cares it&#8217;s still a big number!

What I am really interested to find out is, are any of you actually planners reading the blog? Actually screw it if you are reading this blog **who are you, what do you do??** What would did you like from 2010 and what would you like to see more of in 2010??

Thanks to you all for reading! I will have a post tomorrow with a quick outlook on 2011 in terms of planning as I see it! Stay tuned.
