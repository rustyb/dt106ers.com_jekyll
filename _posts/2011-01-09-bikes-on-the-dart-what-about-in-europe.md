Having heard the recent news regarding [IrishRail][1] allowing the [carriage of Bicycles on board all DART services at off-peak times ][2]I thought it might be a good idea to show off some other cities / countries that allow bikes on board their commuter and intercity services. I wouldn&#8217;t like to be trying to get a bike onto one of the intercity trains though! Who know&#8217;s some day we may even see official policy governing carriage of bikes on the LUAS.



Most countries have been way ahead of the Irish when it comes to transporting bicycles aboard public transport! On a recent interrail trip around europe I witnessed first hand the sheer amount of people that bring their bikes with them where ever they go, I had never seen anything like it! I also wish I had taken more pictures of it as I went.

**Switzerland:**

The SBB CFF FFS allow you to take your bikes on all commuter (regional) trains for free, however you have to pay for a separate bicycle ticket in order to bring one on an inter city train.

**Austria:**

Sticking with the central european countries we move onto Austria, which allow fo significant space on board their &#8220;Wiesel&#8221; commuter trains for bicycles near the doors.

**Netherlands:**

The Dutch famous for their extensive rail network and cycling tradition are no stranger to allowing bicycles on board their trains and public transport alike.

Bikes are allowed on all train services except during the morning and evening rush hours. You need to purchase a Day Card for your bicycle though at the station before boarding a train. Also unlike most rail companies the NS do not provide any special place to put your bike when on the train, that is except for the [EuroCity][3] trains which run through the country. On EuroCity Trains there is a either a carriage for bicycles or a special compartment.

**Germany:**

In order to stop banging on about the same thing I will talk about with in the Cities on there rapid transit networks. In Berlin you are allowed to bring your bike on the U-Bahn (Metro) . You can get away with not paying for the bike ticket, which is very reasonable at €2.50 a day or else €8.50 for the month. Berlin also allows you to take your bike on board trams off peak and also on a number of night bus&#8217;s. [Berlin by bike][4] (in german)

Deutsche Bahn the national rail operator also has a fleet of bikes similar to the dublin bikes for hire at their main stations to allow you to get around the city with ease!

**Copenhagen:**

Of course no bicycle related post would be complete without the inclusion of Copenhagen where their S-Tog has racks for bicycles installed on all of the trains.
