Well it&#8217;s a new week so why don&#8217;t we kick it off with a few of the links I liked in the last week.

**1. The Green Party released a video and the document they submitted as part of the public consultation on the new <a title="[PDF]" href="http://www.dublincity.ie/Planning/Documents/Draft_PRS_291111_web.pdf" target="_blank">Dublin City Council&#8217;s &#8211; Public Realm Strategy</a> [PDF]. The green&#8217;s I think should be commended for the numerous videos they&#8217;ve released lately! Check it out:**

**2. <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0127/breaking14.html" target="_blank">Dublin Bus allowed people to travel for free</a> (on some buses) after the collection system broke down on some buses**

**3. I did a quick write up on my experiences with Dublins Leapcard so far at <a title="Leapcard has still got some living up to do!" href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/01/leapcard-has-still-got-some-living-up-to-do/" target="_blank">Leapcard has still got some living up to do!</a>**

**4. Vincent Browne, love him or hate him, he stuck it to the man like only he can. Vinne was featured on the <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org" target="_blank">Strong Towns Blog</a> (a fantastic resource) in a fairly <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2012/1/23/irish-diversion.html" target="_blank">honest outside commentary on what happened Ireland.</a>**

**5. The Ulster Rugby fans have something to cheer about, Ravenhill has been given [planning permission to renovate the stadium for the first time and increase the capacity][1].**

**6. Inevitably, Bord Pleanala announced they have <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2012/0124/1224310670231.html" target="_blank">delayed making a decision on the National Children&#8217;s Hospital on the Mater site</a>, due in part to the complexity of the application.**
