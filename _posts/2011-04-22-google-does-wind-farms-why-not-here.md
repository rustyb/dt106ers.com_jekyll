A recent post on [mashable.com][1] prompted me to write this post. The postÂ [Google's Next Wind Farm Spend Will Power Its Oklahoma Data Center][2] details how Google has paid for 20 years electricity from the wind farm in order to power a datacenter and help the company be carbon neutrel when it comes to powering its datacenters.

&nbsp;

For those of you unaware, datacenters are huge users of energy and generate huge amounts of heat from all the servers. Google [does not release figures on just how much energy][3] its uses in its datacenters, some sort of issue as regards competition but it has indeed bought the guts of the 100 mW farm in Iowa.

Given that we are striving to be a knowledge economy and one of the trunk international cables makes european land fall here and sure google are here anyway, maybe we could do a deal and get them to locate a major datacenter here and maybe fund a chunk of the [Arklow bank off-shore farm][4] to power it?
