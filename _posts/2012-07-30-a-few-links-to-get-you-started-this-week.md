Well Monday is now dawning upon us once again, and the rather depressing thoughts of 5 whole days until we can veg on fornt of the TV for an entire days watching the Olympics creep into your mind. Fear not! I have a wee pick me up with a few deadly links to brighten up your Monday morning.

First off some style from the ever awesome Copenhagen Cycle Chic with the <a href="http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2012/07/cycle-chic-super-cargo-dads.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CycleChic-CopenhagenGirlsOnBikes+(Copenhagen+Cycle+Chic+-+Bike+Advocacy+in+High+Heels)" target="_blank">Cycle Chic Super Cargo Dads</a>

<a href="http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2012/07/17/uk-ramps-up-intercity-rail-investments/" target="_blank">Apparently there is going to be a bump in spending on the UK rail network outside of the High Speed Lines</a>, now if only Irish Rail could get a piece of that!

Want a chance to be part of changing San Francisco for the better? I can think of a few people not doing a whole lot of work that could give entering this a go! The CityFix carries a note on the opening of entries for the <a href="http://thecityfix.com/blog/call-for-projects-urban-prototyping-festival-2012/" target="_blank"><em>Gray Area Foundation For The Arts (GAFFTA) is calling on all designers, architects, artists, makers, coders and activists to participate in the Urban Prototyping Festival in San Francisco this fall.</em></a>

Finally fastcoexists the design blog asks is <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680214/removing-streets-is-the-only-way-to-reclaim-open-space-in-cities#1" target="_blank">Removing Streets Is The Only Way To Reclaim Open Space In Cities, in light of the massive regeneration around Stratford for the Olympics?</a> I urge you to read this and get involved in the comments!
