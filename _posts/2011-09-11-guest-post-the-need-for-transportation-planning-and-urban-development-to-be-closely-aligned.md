Ireland being an island nation with its major ports on the east and south coasts of the country relies heavily on road transport for the distribution of imported goods nationally. There is a minor reliance on rail transport for distribution of goods as it is considered to be more efficient to use the road network to deliver small and bulk freight. One way of addressing the issue is to look at the subject of transportation and land use and how we can reduce journey times between towns and cities throughout the country.

## Background

    The Von Thünen Model for use of land
  </p>
</div>

It was revealed by JH Von Thünen in his 1826 paper “The Isolated State” that from an agricultural perspective, transport and the location of goods could be more efficiently dealt with by locating fresh produce growing appropriately to optimal transport corridors which would deliver the goods more efficiently and cost effectively. We can use

this example to demonstrate the sustainability of land use when transport is considered in an urban context. Von Thünen's theory stated that the products with the highest production costs would be located closest to the market place. For example, grain production would be located closer than livestock production to the market place.

Although Von Thünen was demonstrating the efficiency of the transportation of agricultural produce, the theory can be explored to look at how this concept can be applied to the transport of people from residential areas to retail and commercial areas. In other words, how we deal with people movement as well as the movement of goods.

<a title="5.3.1 Housing in Urban Areas, National Spatial Strategy 2002 ? 2020, page 103" href="http://nss.ie/pdfs/Completea.pdf" target="_blank">The National Spatial Strategy (NSS)</a>promotes the strategic and sequential release of land whilst concentrating development in areas where “it is possible” to integrate employment, retail & commercial as well as public transport. The NSS also advocates consolidation of existing areas and regeneration of brown field sites ahead of green field sites. This is clearly a ‘work with what we have' approach as it uses the networks already existing, or at the very least, networks that could be conveniently reintroduced.

Building on Von Thünen's model, Alonso came up with a more modern approach through his Bid Rent Curve or what is sometimes known as the Central Business District Theory (CBD). This theory related to the location of business to the critical masses. The logic of the CBD theory was that the greater access to population for business, the more profitable it could be in commercial terms.

## Global Factors

At present we are experiencing political unrest in middle?eastern countries such as Libya, Iraq and Bahrain as well as Tunisia and Egypt. The impact such unrest is having on Europe is fundamental as the political stability of countries such as Iraq, Libya and Bahrain have a direct influence on the price of oil. At time of writing, <a title="Brent Crude Oil, Tuesday, 22nd March 2011" href="http://www.oil?price.net" target="_blank">the cost of crude oil has reached $110 a barrel (22 March)</a>. The affect of political unrest on the production of oil is a major factor in the cost but so is the transportation of oil as freight.

It is estimated that 3 million barrels of oil travel daily via the Suez Canal, which is controlled by Egypt. Primarily this freight is bound for the USA and to a lesser extent, the Western European market (Vanderbruck, 2011).

Not only does this raise the issue of how strategic transportation of oil coming from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is to Europe and the United States of America, it also raises the issue of what those western continents must do to address the heavy reliance on fossil fuels produced in the middle? east. This puts an onus on the Western economies to address how we deal with the supply of a product vital to the sustainability of all the countries that have become major end?users.

The subject of oil and the reliance of Ireland on it during recessionary times, poses a serious question in terms of transport and land use. Urban transport in Ireland up to now has not been problem because we have always had an abundance of reasonably affordable oil to power our public and private transport. However, with unrest in the middle?east and no indigenous supply of our own during the worst economic downturn in the history of the state, Ireland is vulnerable and must look to reduce our heavy reliance on imported fuels. We can do so by looking at how and where we

locate our central business districts and residential areas. This also leads back to the NSS and the policy of consolidating built up areas.

## Political Factors

In 2009 the then Irish government made up of Fianna Fail/Green Party brought forward a policy document called Smarter Travel – A Sustainable Transport Future. This document outlines the difficulties faced by Ireland during the current economic recession in terms of transport provision and presents a plan to address the needs amid current economic constraints.

In his foreword of the document, <a title="Smarter Travel PDF" href="http://www.smartertravel.ie/download/1/NS1264_Smarter_Travel_english_PN_WEB.pdf" target="_blank">Minister Noel Dempsey acknowledges that current transport trends are unsustainable and pursuing outdated policies will have an adverse impact on the economy and society in general</a>. The document also acknowledges the importance of aligning transport and spatial planning to prevent urban sprawl. The culmination of the policy is that smarter travel is encouraged as an alternative to private car use. The policy offers a commitment to radically changing and improving the public transport system to encourage people to live in closer proximity to places of employment. It is a very strong policy document but is unlikely to be adhered to by the new Fine Gael/Labour government.

<a title="The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014" href="http://www.budget.gov.ie/The%20National%20Recovery%20Plan%202011-2014.pdf" target="_blank">The current Programme for Government 2011 – 2016 is weak in terms of direction for promotion of sustainable land use and how it will be addressed but there is mention of giving more control to local communities in terms of transport and traffic</a> that could be a positive step toward bringing the powers of delivering public transport and roads into the local governance sphere rather than the current centralised model currently in place whereby national government delivers on public transport and other community infrastructure such as schools and health care facilities. If such a policy is implemented by the current Minister for Local Government, we may see a new joined up approach to transport planning and spatial planning which will benefit the quality of life for citizens.

## Density

As mentioned earlier, the NSS promotes consolidation of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) to ensure economic competitiveness as well as ensuring a cohesive approach in terms of development. Crucial to future consolidation is the densities of residential developments. It is essential to encourage higher densities to manage the supply of local services in a more efficient way. When we allow urban sprawl to occur, we stretch the provision of services such utility provision and public transport. For

example, if the Rural Housing Policy of Fingal County Council was abolished and it becomes easier for people to build one?off housing units on agricultural sites, we will create urban sprawl but more detrimentally we will create a situation whereby sewage treatment cannot be provided, public transport does not serve areas where population growth is taking place because of the sporadic development.

However, if we designate land around Balbriggan train station where people can live in close proximity to a transport hub, this will create a more sustainable lifestyle for the residents who can avail of transport provision close to where they live. The latter scenario is what is being promoted and supported by the NSS and RPGs in an effort to bring land use and transport together, thus encouraging people to live and work in areas accessible by transport.

## Urban Transport

Currently planning authorities are working from policies within the RPGS which promote development along key transport corridors. According to the RPGs, two types of Green Belt have been established, large outer greenbelts to earmark areas where the minimum level of development should take place and smaller connector green belts where space between urban areas and rural areas can be preserved. Consolidation of development has been an objective of planning guidelines since the publication of the SPGs in 1999. Policies delivering consolidation of development are pursued in order to concentrate development around transport corridors with the objective of minimising urban trips using private transport. Concentrating development around transport nodes ensures an efficient use of public transport as an alternative to private transport.

## Conclusion

Taking into consideration global factors such as the cost of imported fossil fuels which will influence travel patterns of both private and business users, it is vitally important for planners to bring together transport planning and urban development through consolidation. The economic factors such as availability of disposable income and access to cheap finance which was abundant during the “Celtic Tiger” years but now dramatically lower mean that policies within the National Spatial Strategy and the Regional Planning Guidelines are essential to address the quality of life for people who may not be in a financial position to obtain private transport. In addition, bringing together transport planning and urban development ensures a more cost effective way to deliver public transport projects to support the existing communities and those emerging.

It is clear that with policies such as the NSS in place to consolidate our developed areas we are moving in the right direction. However, the question must be asked as to whether we have the political will to concentrate development in appropriate areas designated for that purpose. The matter of ‘Ghost Estates' along with the overhang of land zoned for development in a number of local authorities throughout Ireland would tell us that there must be a change in the political culture ahead of any sustainable approach to a more cohesive relationship between transport and land use. Until the mindset of our public representatives is set to deliver on sustainable development, we will continue to see sporadic land zoning occurring with urban sprawl being the result. It will take a number of decades for infrastructure to catch up and until then populations of those areas will be subjected to a low quality of life where inadequate physical and social infrastructure are the norm.
