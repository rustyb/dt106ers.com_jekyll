Written submissions will can be made up until **4:40PM on Friday, 12**<sup><strong>th</strong></sup>**March 2010**. All submissions or observations received during the above time period will be taken into consideration before the making of the Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017.

The development plan has its own website which can be viewed at the following link: <a title="Dublin City DEvelopment Plan Website" href="http://www.dublincitydevelopmentplan.ie" target="_blank">http://www.dublincitydevelopmentplan.ie<br /> </a>

It is quiet interesting to note that on the website the council have prepared a number of videos detailing there key vision for the city. The authority have taken a different tack to completing the this development plan, a vision for 2030 has identified the steps it feels necessary to achieve this 2030 vision.

> **The 2030 Vision**
> 
> &#8216;Dublin 2030&#8242; is a compact city, with a distinct character, a vibrant culture and a smart, innovative economy. It&#8217;s a city of urban neighbourhoods, connected by good public transport and green spaces. In 2030, Dublin is one of the most sustainable, dynamic and resourceful cities in Europe.  
> *DCC,2010*

The council has identified 3 areas which of the strategy which it feels can be achieved during the lifetime of the plan.

> To develop Dublin as a place that:
> 
> *   is clean, green, compact and connected
> *   has an innovative, smart economy
> *   contains sustainable neighbourhoods &amp; communities

There is plenty of information on the website and i encourage anyone to go and look at this website as the information is very accessible to anyone who wishes to find out more about the draft development plan.

If you wish to make a submission the Draft Plan please do! After all it is a plan that will affect you in your daily life, how you run your business and above all else how you want your city to look in the future.

I will be following this post up with a number of post&#8217;s in the not to distant future once i get to grip with the issues presented in the plan ad as to whether this &#8220;2030 Vision&#8221; is a load of hogwash or a new direction for the development of Dublin City.
