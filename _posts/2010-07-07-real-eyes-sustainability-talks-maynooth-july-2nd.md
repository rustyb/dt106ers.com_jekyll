A very big thank you to Daragh and John at Real eyes Sustainability for having students along to these talks. they were great! Really made you felt good about your profession and hey maybe we as individuals can change our world for the better.

I have attached the presentations which john ever so graciously uploaded to the real eyes website:

An absoulutly fantastic presentation by Dick glesson the chief planner for Dublin City. A very interesting style, he used moleskin pages and little sketches as his material, very clear and easy to understand. Having heard him it really makes me feel as if the council is being serious about the future and wants to take the natural step and get many more people involved in the process of making Dublin a sustainable amazing place to live!



Yet another brilliant one from Ken Melamed, Mayor of Whistler, Canada. Ken you the man!  


Hope you enjoy the presentations, well worth a look!
