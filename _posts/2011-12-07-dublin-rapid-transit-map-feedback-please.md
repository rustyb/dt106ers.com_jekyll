Ok anyone who has met me or listened to me talk about transport will know I&#8217;m a bit of nut for mass public transport and how its portrayed to the public.

Not sure if you remember but last year a Aris Venetikidis completed a future fantasy (with a lot of fact) complete transport map for Dublin as part of his design masters at NCAD, you can view his work on his website <a title="Aris Website" href="http://www.venetikidis.com/ArisV/DUBLIN_TRANSPORT_MAP.html" target="_blank">ventikidis.com</a>. It was fantastic to finally see someone produce something well thought out and could actually work, except for there was one problem it didn&#8217;t reflect what is on the ground now!

We all know Dublin&#8217;s public transport network is not the best but hey it works (most of the time). So I figured we don&#8217;t have a map showing the most frequent routes in the city, so why not make one? Here is what I have come up with, it include [Dublin Bus][1], <a href="http://www.luas.ie" target="_blank">Luas</a> and [Irish Rail/DART][2]:

## The Map

Please I would love to hear feedback from you regarding the above map, any and all feedback is welcome via twitter email or the comments below!

## So what is Rapid Transit?

There is a pretty standard definition the world offer that most will agree on and that is:

> A Rapid Transit Route is one in which a service operates at frequency of 15 minutes or less

You might be wondering why there are some routes missing off the above map. Well I shall explain, I conducted an extensive audit of all the Dublin Bus timetables for all bus routes. I got an average peak frequency for the buses and then found there average off-peak frequency for Monday &#8211; Friday buses only. All routes shown above operate Monday &#8211; Sunday however Saturday and Sunday frequencies can vary substantially from weekday frequency. So you can view the spreadsheet below which is the data I was working from:
