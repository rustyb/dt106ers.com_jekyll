This is great to hear, lets hope there isn&#8217;t a hames made of the rural broadband scheme. Also a wee bit of skepticism but, are the speeds as quoted really achieved all the time or are they just maximum speeds you can expect on the lines?

> EVERY PROPERTY in the State will be able to avail of internet broadband by 2012, Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan has said.
> 
> Announcing the completion of the National Broadband Scheme at Government Buildings yesterday, Mr Ryan said that it meant coverage had now increased from 85 to 99 per cent of properties.
> 
> The remaining 1 per cent, or 12,000 properties, would be covered by a soon to be announced rural broadband scheme, which would be completed in 2012.
> 
> The national scheme was delivered by communications group 3 Ireland and cost €220 million. It has made broadband available to 235,000 homes in 1,028 areas across rural Ireland.
> 
> 3 Ireland has a contract to provide the service until 2014.
> 
> Some €44 million of funding for the project was provided by the exchequer and €36 million came from the European Union Regional Development Fund 2007-2013, with 3 Ireland providing the remainder.
> 
> A connection with a minimum download speed of 1.6MBits/sec and maximum of 14.4MBits/sec has been made available under the scheme. 3 Ireland said speeds of up to 40 MBits/sec would be available by the end of 2011.
> 
> Mr Ryan said the information and communications technology sector in Ireland grew by 6 per cent last year. He was hopeful that level of growth could be doubled and the 75,000 jobs in the sector would be added to.
> 
> A recent OECD survey found Ireland had 20.3 fixed-line broadband connections per 100 inhabitants at the end of June, down from 21.3 in June 2009.
