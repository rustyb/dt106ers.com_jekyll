> A report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found its officials and local authorities issued 10,000 enforcement actions over the last two years.
> 
> The study &#8211; Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland &#8211; found the EPA issued 45 legally binding directions to local authorities two years ago to meet tougher drinking water standards.
> 
> The concerns centred around poor filter operations and the lack of alert systems such as chlorine monitors.
> 
> Some 339 drinking water supplies posed a concern in 2007. Since then 83 have come off, but another 62 were added. The body said it intends to examine supplies on the Remedial Action List further over the next two years to improve drinking water standards.

>   
> Dara Lynott, EPA director, said: “Ireland's success in implementing environmental legislation will be defined by how well Ireland responds to the challenge of providing waste, wastewater and drinking water infrastructure.
> 
> “This investment needs to be matched by investment in people to operate and manage these assets.”
> 
> The EPA study also found harmful emissions from chemical plants fell almost two-thirds over the last 12 years even though production soared.
> 
> Mr Lynott said the improvements in the chemical field should be replicated in areas such as waste and water treatment.
> 
> “I think that what we're saying is that the template that we're using for industry needs to be replicated by local authorities,” Mr Lynott said.
> 
> “If they do that, if they invest in infrastructure and we do our job right in highlighting where the risks are, I think we will lead the type of reductions in pollutants that we're currently seeing from industry.”
> 
> According to the report, emissions from the pharmaceutical/chemical industries fell 59 per cent between 1995 and 2007, yet production jumped 70 per cent.
> 
> Mr Lynott said regulation was not a barrier to trade and claimed the chemical sector should be seen as a blueprint for the type of industries Ireland needs to attract to meet tough emissions targets.
> 
> “A lot of that innovation in terms of green technologies is being driven by regulations,” Mr Lynott said.
