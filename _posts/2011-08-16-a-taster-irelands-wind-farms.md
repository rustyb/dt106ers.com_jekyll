I seem to be starting all my posts like this of late, yet again, its been a long time since the last post. I&#8217;m back in DIT and working on the transport stuff again after my time in Bord Pleanala.

As part of my work in the Bord I did a small bit of research into the whole area of all the wind turbine applications that passed through the boards doors. The idea was to identify the main issues that crop up in all the planning appeals.

All cases which involved wind turbines were identified. Below is a map of all the granted applications by the Bord since 1998 for applications involving 6 turbines or more:



[Link to the Larger Map][1] (Pls note some of the geolocated points are in the wrong location these will be fixed in time)

## By the Numbers

In total **1530** turbines were applied for, only **872** were granted permission on appeal.

The county with the greatest number of turbines with permission is Mayo with 216 turbines, the majority of which are part of the Bellacorrick wind farm.

Next week I will dig a little deeper into the data that I gathered on our windfarms and detail some of the main issues considered during the assessment of these applications including links to the spreadsheets containing the data. However until then, **the big question is just how many of these have been built?**
