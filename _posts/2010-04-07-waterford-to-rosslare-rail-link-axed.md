> Iarnród Éireann has confirmed it is to cease passenger services on the Waterford to Rosslare line in the southeast.
> 
> The company said it will explore the possibility of keeping the line open as a tourist/heritage railway, but it maintained that with passenger numbers at 25 per day, the route was &#8220;unsustainable&#8221;.
> 
> A closing date for the route, which was one of those identified for examination by the recent McCarthy report, is expected to be announced by Iarnród Éireann soon.

> 
> The company has frequently warned of falling passenger numbers on the Waterford to Rosslare line while the sugar beet freight business, which sustained the route, ceased in 2006.
> 
> A trial extension of the passenger service from Rosslare to Wexford was under-utilised the company said.
> 
> A recent survey of passengers indicated most users were heading for Waterford Institute of Technology. Accordingly, the company said a bus service would replace the train, taking passengers to the institute, in about the same time, for about the same price.
> 
> Iarnród Éireann said there would also be environmental benefits of running a small bus, as opposed to a train.
> 
> It is understood that discussed have taken place with staff working on the route interested in redeployment within Iarnród Éireann. Voluntary severance is also to be offered.
> 
> The company said rail transport was &#8220;a volume business&#8221; and the passenger numbers spoke for themselves.
