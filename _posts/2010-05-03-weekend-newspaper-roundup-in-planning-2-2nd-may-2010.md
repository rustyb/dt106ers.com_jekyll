Not much in the papers this week. The highlights being gross residential overzoning in the State, but 800, 000 homes &#8211; that cant be right. The Liffey man is to be cancelled indefinitely and the continuing dispute over the change in Limerick Border continues.

## Irish Independent

Not too much going on in the papers this weekend, but the indo has highlighted a major issue that there is gross overzoning of lands for residential development in towns around Ireland. They quote a figure of up to 800, 000 more homes could be built on the lands &#8211; but how much of that land is located on a flood plain or a place where legally the councils can no longer zone?

**Land rezoned for 800,000 more homes than needed** - [http://bit.ly/c7tUp5  
][1]*Meath is the worst offender according to the report*

**Meath is worst overzoning offender** &#8211; [http://bit.ly/d6qeWW  
][2]*Following on from the the 800, 000 more homes story*

**Eco-village people build community from ground up** &#8211; <http://bit.ly/9ctM9q>  
*At Cloughjordan, Co. Tipperary. It&#8217;s a slow start for a unique project, but its backers are high-energy, says Jerome Reilly*
