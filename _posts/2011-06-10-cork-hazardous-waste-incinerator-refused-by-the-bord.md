An Bord Pleanla has refused planning permission by direction today for the proposed amended Waster to Energy Hazardous Waste Plant (for you and me an incinerator).

I can&#8217;t seem to find the direction on the <a href="http://www.pleanala.ie/" target="_blank">Bord&#8217;s website</a> yet however the original bord file can be found [here][1].

As the application was considered strategic infrastructure it has its own website:<a title="Ringaskiddy Waste to Energy website (Indaver)" href="http://www.ringaskiddywastetoenergy.ie/" target="_blank"> www.ringaskiddywastetoenergy.ie</a>

This post will be update when the conditions for refusal become available. But one can safely assume as part of the EIS, Indavor could not mitigate against the concerns raised in relation to flooding and emissions.

Below is the article from the irish times on the news:

> An Bord Pleanála has refused planning permission to Indaver Ireland for a proposed €150 million twin incinerator project in Cork harbour.
> 
> An Bord Pleanála signed off on the decision yesterday for the proposal for the Ringaskiddy site and communicated the decision to the various parties today.
> 
> Indaver Ireland had originally applied for planning permission for a 100,000 tonne hazardous waste incinerator, a 140,000 tonnes municipal waste incinerator and a transfer station.
> 
> In January 2010, Bord Pleánala refused planning for the municipal waste incinerator but said it was considering granting planning for the hazardous waste incinerator and the transfer station.
> 
> It said Indaver should make some changes to its environmental impact statement to address concerns over flooding, coastal erosion and revised emissions.
> 
> In May 2010, Indaver reduced the size of the buildings by 40 per cent while retaining the same capacity while it also made changes so water would be recycled rather than discharged.
> 
> Environmental group Chase has campaigned against the project saying the proposed site is unsuitable due to risk of flooding and erosion.
> 
> During a four-week oral hearing in May and June 2009, the group also questioned the need for the facility and expressed concern about its impact on public health in the harbour area.
