    Having finally got off my ass to resume blogging the Metro North project is cropping up more and more in the news! I see that a lobby group has be officially launched (I reckon relaunched but anyway!) the <a title="Yes to Metro - Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Yes-to-metro-north/170835799625749">&#8216;Yes to Metro North</a>&#8216; Facebook community. It is being described by the North Dublin TD, Clare Daly as:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8216;This is the only shovel-ready transport project, with planning completed, millions already spent on it and the only project with funding in place.&#8217;
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Which I can say is probably true, however it&#8217;s not &#8216;shovel ready&#8217; as the relocation of the depot still has to go through probable oral hearing with a decision not likely until October where the project will receive build permission as part of the conditions attached to the railway order. Documents relating to the Depot relocation to Dardistown are available at <a href="http://www.dublinmetronorthdepot.ie/">www.dublinmetronorthdepot.ie</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am inclined to agree with the cooments attributed to the unnamed former Fingal County Council planner in a recent <a href="http://www.fingal-independent.ie/news/campaign-to-save-metro-unveiled-2661994.html">Fingal Independent article</a>.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8230;.a former Fingal County Council planner has warned there is &#8216;no way&#8217; Metro will be built, given the lack of funds and skewed projected population figures.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Now I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as saying its never going to be built as we must remember Railway Orders made under the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 remain in force forever effectively. Unlike Planning Permissions which have an effective life if extended of 10 year, Railway Orders have no defined lifespan. So lets not get too freaked out just yet it can still be built, maybe not in the next 10 years though!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Comments by the Minister that the old plan of <a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/dart-airport-plan-on-track-as-metro-north-hits-the-buffers-2635349.html">linking the Airport with the Northern Line at Clongriffen</a> are laudable, like come on if that was to happen it would have been built already! The whole Metro concept of linking the airport to the city centre while also serving communities is the whole point of it not just a rail link to the airport.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We seem to be going one step forward in terms of aspiration and two steps backwards in terms of clarity of what it is we want. Is the policy to put a rail link to the airport or is it to provide a rail link to the airport to Ballymun. The investment plan Transport 21 seems to have been quietly cancelled, which could be the final death nail for the Metro for the time being.

    We are looking to 20 year solutions, why i ask? There needs to be a radical shake up of transport policy for Dublin, something which 2030 vision is not going to deliver since it is a rehash of all the transport 21 projects. More pragmatic solutions need to be proposed! Something like a BRT based line that would run along the Ballymun road as an interim stop measure or stepping stone until the Metro can be built.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Undoubtedly I will rant more about alternative solutions in the coming weeks!
