Was on the way to get the bus home today when I came across one of these at the 27B bus stop on Eden Key outside SIPTU:

What is it you might ask? Why it&#8217;s realtime passenger information as deployed by the[ QBN Office][1]! I must confess I was a non believer that this would ever happen in Dublin, but I have been proven wrong, there it is at a bus stop during its initial testing phase before full live deployment. The project as far as I am aware is due for completion in **Q2 2011.** [Reference to follow]

Interesting to note is that the sign appears to be branded **&#8220;Transport for Ireland.&#8221;** I wonder will it be abbreviated to TFI? I can&#8217;t seem to find any reference to on google searches, but who knows this could be the new marketing name for our integrated transport systems. Obviously just copying [ Transport for London (TFL) ][2].

**HOLD THE PHONE!**

There is a **live test version of the RTP information available here:** <http://dublin.acisconnect.com/>  
Not all of the routes are live but some of the main bus stops are though as witnessed below:

If you are interested in how the RTPI is implemented and its current progress you should check out this presentation by Brendan O&#8217;Brien from the Dublin City Council, IT Department.

It would also appear that the Quality Bus Network Office have a [new website in development][3], I stumbled across it&#8217;s test site before christmas and meant to post a link on the blog. Of note is the map showing the current [QBC Network][4] which displays the two orbital routes numbered 11 and 12.

Let me know what you think of the project so far, comments as always are welcome!
