This pole appeared over night at the 41 bus stop on Abbey Street, so I am assuming it is only a matter of time before we have signs attached and working real time passenger (RTP) information similar to other european cities. According to a recent tweet by Minister Ciaran Cuffe RTP is to be launched before the end of this month.

Finally out of the dark ages regarding Bus transport, next stop integrated ticketing, although i have my grievances about the implementation they have proposed, but that&#8217;s for a separate post another day. Apologies for the poor quality of the picture, really harsh sunshine this evening!
