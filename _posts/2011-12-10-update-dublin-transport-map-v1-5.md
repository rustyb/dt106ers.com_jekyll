First I would like to say thanks a million to all those who provided feedback on my first version of the Dublin transport map, you all know who you are, thank you! Before I show you the revised map I would like to explain my design process a bit better so as to clear up some of the issues raised in [the feedback to the original post][1].

## Background

My dissertation in college focused on this idea of the network effect in public transport with study on the north eastern area of Dublin (Santry across to Howth), while also critiquing the differences in spatial land use policy and transport policy. That is a post for another day though.

There is no map of Dublin that shows the Dublin Bus, Luas and Rail networks on one sheet of paper. The closest<a title="Aris Maps" href="www.venetikidis.com/ArisV/DUBLIN_TRANSPORT_MAP.html" target="_blank"> representation is by Aris</a> but also includes other possible modifications.

What really spawned this map was that I have been working on a geographically accurate map of all Dublin&#8217;s Transport in a similar style to the <a title="Line plans for Ile-de-France Transport, RATP" href="http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_20559/plans-des-lignes/" target="_blank">maps produced of Paris</a>. But this map would also show the frequency of routes simply by varying the thickness of the lines. It is showing the frequency part that is the major challenge using illustrator as any minor changes are much more difficult than using a grid like with the map below.

Also as has been pointed out by a number of tweets such as this one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="143312156341972993">

    @<a href="https://twitter.com/rusty1052">rusty1052</a> But Rusty, about 13% of the region&#8217;s population live north of the airport and another 8% live in Dublin 15

  </p>
</blockquote>

As such there is also a slightly loaded message behind this map in that it can&#8217;t address a large proportion of the Dublin population lives in both Swords and the Dublin 15 area, where rapid services are very limited. It is also a shame that no orbital services like the 17A lack frequencies to allow seamless transfers. Instead most transfers have to made within the city centre.

Finally the current cash fare system penalizes people who need to make transfers to complete a trip by charging full fares twice. Hopefully the <a title="NTA Website" href="http://nationaltransport.ie" target="_blank">National Transport Authority</a> will soon fix this as they are they have the power to set fares as part of the Public Transport Licensing process.

## Objectives

*   Only services which operate at 15 minute of less frequency Monday &#8211; Friday off-peak will be represented on the map.
*   To show all transport modes, Bus, Light Rail (Luas) and Heavy Rail (DART & Commuter)
*   To illustrate the frequent network of transport routes that are available in Dublin.
*   To show the places which are possible to transfer as part of your journey.
*   To create the first multi-modal map of Dublin.

## Map v 1.5 [UPDATE 2.o]

**Why version 1.5?** The map is still in development and I have not implemented the full array of suggestion that people were so kind to make in the comments on the last post.

## The Future

I hope to refine the map into a usable product with the ultimate goal of pitching it to the National Transport Authority for use in Dublin.

I&#8217;m considering the addition of some combined routes, including the number 41&#8242;s which operate to Swords and beyond, which when combined roughly have an off-peak frequency of 15 mins. The 25&#8242;s and 26 to Lucan are similar in that combined they will be of sufficient frequency. Another feature which no one noticed was that Docklands Rail station is also missing and it will be added in a future release.

As I mentioned earlier I have been working on a complete Dublin Transport map which shows all services in the Dublin Region. This is a huge job! Unfortunately that is on the back burner as I have lost my enthusiasm it due to the difficulties of representing each and every route in the inner city. It is a nightmare as almost every Dublin Bus service stops on either D&#8217;Olier Street or Westmoreland Street. This map will take many months to complete to the same standard as the Frequent Map above. If someone has a GIS solution that they could put forward as alternative solution to hand drawing the map I would be over the moon! Here is a preview of that map in its current work in progress state:
