> AN BORD Plean치la has sounded the death knell for a planned major development aimed at revitalising Wicklow Town&#8217;s struggling business sector.
> 
> Lusra Teoranta had lodged an appeal to the planning board after Wicklow County Council refused permission for the Marlton Quarter development. But An Bord Plean치la agreed with the council and turned down the appeal.
> 
> The mixed retail, commercial and residential development was to include a shopping mall, retail units, multiplex cinema, medical centre, leisure facilities, art centre, youth centre, hotel and leisure centre, bowling alley, pubs, cafes and restaurants.

> Wicklow&#8217;s mayor, Irene Winters, strongly believed the development could have been hugely beneficial to the town. THE HUGE Marlton Quarter Retail and Commercial Development now looks dead in the water after An Bord Plean치la turned down an appeal against earlier refusal by Wicklow County Council.
> 
> The mixed use retail/commercial and residential development was to include a shopping centre, retail units, a cinema, medical centre, hotel, restaurants, offices and 408 residential units.
> 
> In August of 2008, Wicklow County Council refused planning permission for the major retail development, causing considerable anger amongst some local councilors and developers. However, those opposed to the development claimed it would help to kill off shopping along the town&#8217;s Main Street and centre if it were to get the go-ahead.
> 
> An appeal was lodged with An Bord Plean치la by Lusra Teoranta care of Simon Clear and Associates of 3 Terenure Road West, Terenure, Dublin and the site was inspected on November 12 2008 and January 18 of 2009.
> 
> The board decided to refuse permission, as recommended by the inspector, and outlined a number of reasons for their decisions.
> 
> &#8216;It is considered that, by reason of its size and scale, the proposed development would be excessive having regard to the core area of Wicklow town and would not link effectively with the existing town centre so that there is commercial synergy between the development and town,&#8217; states the report.
