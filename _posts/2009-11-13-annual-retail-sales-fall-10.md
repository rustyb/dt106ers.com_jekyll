> &#8220;The decline in consumer expenditure since the beginning of 2008 has been driven by a combination of a fall in disposable income arising from a drop in employment income, and a rise in incomes taxes and levies. In addition, the erosion of personal wealth due to declining asset prices, together with increased uncertainty as reflected in the indicators of consumer confidence, has prompted an increase in precautionary saving by households.

However, it also found that consumers are spending the least amount per transaction in more than two years at an average of €45.64 in the third quarter, down from €66.74 a year earlier.
