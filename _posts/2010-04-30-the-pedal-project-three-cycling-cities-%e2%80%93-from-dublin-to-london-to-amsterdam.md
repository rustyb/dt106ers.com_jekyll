I came across this short programme produced for DCTV.ie (Dublin Community TV) on vimeo today. I thought it was an interesting idea to follow the Dublin City Council Cycle Officer &#8211; Ciaran Fallon to two other european cities, London and Amsterdam, to see how they are doing it.

[The Pedal Project: Three Cycling Cities – From Dublin to London to Amsterdam][1] from [DCTV][2] on [Vimeo][3].

In London where they are currently building there cycle culture, however it is not there yet. Ciaran visited hackey in east london where cycling currently accounts for 19% of all trips in the area. Of note from Amsterdamn are the fact that there transport policy includes cycling in its hierarchy, which is as follows:

1.  Public Transport (Trams, Buses and Taxis)
2.  **Cyclists and Pedestrians**
3.  Private Transport (Car&#8217;s)

According to the founder of [amsterdamize.com][4], a great website which celebrates Dutch cycling culture, the &#8220;worst way to promote cycling is by saying its green&#8221;. I have to agree with this strongly in that, making people feel like a bad person for not choosing to use the bike is a very bad way to encourage people to take it up.

I know Dublin is hilly and not as nice to cycle around as Amsterdam, but we have the potential to make a big dent in the model share and to get cycling back to being a big thing in Dublin. Remember you dont have to look like a tit with all your cycling gear! To leave you with the amsterdamize slogan:

> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">
>   &#8220;100% Lycra-Free, Guaranteed&#8221;
> </p>

I wish Ciaran Nolan the best of luck in pushing this agenda in Dublin, all we need is some political support!
