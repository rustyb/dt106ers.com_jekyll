After reading an article in the [Irish Times entitled &#8220;Regional airport cuts &#8216;should be reconsidered&#8217;&#8221; by Lorna Siggens][1]. Given that the article was about the the subsidization of PSO (public service obligation) air routes within Ireland and how a late decision by the former Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey to cut costs by only subsidizing Dublin &#8211; Donegal from July and how these routes are vital for tourism and business in the far flung parts of Ireland due to there sub 2 hour travel times. What other routes are served by the various regional airports? So 20 minutes of research later and a bit of google docs magic here are the results:

*   **28 Regular **service non Irish destinations served by various different Airlines on non PSO routes.
*   The **majority of non Irish routes** are to the **UK**.
*   **Dublin is served by all of the airports except Waterford**.

*[Regional Airport Routes in Ireland][2]  
*

* *

*Information was compiled from the respective websites of each airport.*

From this brief overview it shows that Sligo will stand to loose the most out of the removal of the PSO&#8217;s since Dublin &#8211; Sligo is its only route. All the regional airports bar Donegal and Sligo link into worldwide Hubs in London with all main airports served aside from London Heathrow (LHR).

Assuming most of these routes are economical to be run by the various Airline Operators all the airports currently provide major links for there respective regions through the network effect thanks to their connections to the Dublin, London and the UK.

Maybe a better use of the funds allocated to the PSO routes would be to provide proper connecting transport service to and from each airport to their respective tourism and regional destinations, to make something similar to the airline hub system to improve the land transportation.
