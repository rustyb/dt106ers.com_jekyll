[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1441" title="30_prepaid_Ticket" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/30_prepaid_Ticket-290x290.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="290" />][1]I started my Easter Sunday off a wee little bit pissed of when i saw this gem in my google reader from the [Dublin Bus General News Feed][2]:

> <a id="-5301679280312292036_entry_title" href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/News-Centre/Travel-News/New-Prepaid-Ticket-Fares-2011/" target="_blank">New Prepaid Ticket Fares 2011</a>
> 
> Dublin Bus wishes to advise customers that the price of some discounted prepaid fares will be increased from Sunday 1st may 2011. Please see table below for new prepaid fares. Prepaid Ticket Old Price New Price 1-Day Adult Rambler   €6.00  to‚ €6.20 3-Day Adult Rambler €13.30 to‚ €13.50 5 Day Adult Rambler €21.00 to‚ €22.00 Rambler 30 Day Adult €105.00 to, €110.00 Rambler 5 Day Student €15.70 to €16.50 Rambler 30&#8230;

Having quickly scanned through it i clicked the link to find out how much more I would be paying for my 30 day student bus ticket next week to get this:

<div id="attachment_1432" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-24-at-18.50.00.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1432" title="Dublin Bus News feed failed link" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-24-at-18.50.00-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    What you get when you click the above link in the quote
  </p>
</div>

That&#8217;s right the news item does not exist anymore! Needless to say I&#8217;m not very happy at all, under one weeks notice that fares are going up!? A small piece of research on the [NTA website][3] revealed that under their [performance obligations][4] of the contract with the NTA:

> Fares InformationUp-to-date fares information for all fare categories and all services to be available on the BÁC website.  Fare changes to be announced on the website as early as possible and not less than 5 working days in advance of the change taking place.
> 
> Quarterly Report
> 
> **Availability of information and minimum 5 working days notice re changes**

Also on further inspection of the [contract they signed in 2009][5], only cash fare increases require the prior written approval of the [National Transport Authority][6] and not the prepaid tickets! Sorry for all the quotes but this is ludicrous:

> Section 14.2: Pending the development and implementation of a fare scheme under section 59 of the Act of 2008, any increase in controlled fares  in respect of the Services shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Authority.  This requirement  for the prior written approval of the Authority shall not apply to discounted fares, prepaid fares, concessionary fares or multi-journey fares.

So essentially the NTA can&#8217;t force them to make fares cheaper? Someone please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. It is beyond me how fares can increase pretty much every 6 months, that is if my memory serves me correctly. It&#8217;s not like services have magically got a million times better! Now they have improved but still there is no integrated multi modal fare ticket, have they even thought of making a zonal fare system which will allow people to transfer with out being penalized?

### [UPDATE]

Dublin bus released there fare prices today on the website, but get this it&#8217;s not on the homepage, you have to go to the news page to find it! The spreadsheet below was made using the prices on the various prepaid ticket pages as on the 24th April, is it they had already updated some of the prices or are just lying about the prices on the updated price list. For instance the Monthly Adult Travelwide is quoted as €100.00 on the prepaid paid page yet the press release says its old price(the current one) is €98.00. Poor form guys. Below are the updated prices. You can view the press realease here: [New Prepaid Ticket Fares 2011][7]
