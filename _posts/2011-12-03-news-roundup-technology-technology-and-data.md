We start this week wit the announcement of a new website ram packed with old Central Statistics Office data from the last census but shows a lot of promise!

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1759" title="Decision Map.ie" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-02-at-19.01.48-1024x549.png" alt="" width="1024" height="549" />][1]

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Decision Map</span>

[DecisionMap.ie ][2]- Is  new online resource which maps census data on a number of levels including the electoral distrcts and provides one of those cool percentage box type things on the right hand side like they had on [WhereDoesMyMoneyGo][3]. First impressions are it&#8217;s pretty cool, it would be great if it went all the way down to the enumerator areas while also being able to compare data across census periods, but sure maybe that will happen in the future!
