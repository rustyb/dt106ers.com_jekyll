Bit of a dramatic title that but, I have been missing for the last while getting settled into my new job and the whirlwind of change that has kicked off. Anyway enough about me! It&#8217;s been an exciting few weeks as regards planning in Ireland goes, with significant developments in terms of the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0317/1224313472810.html" target="_blank">Children&#8217;s Hospital being refused permission</a>, the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0331/1224314164228.html" target="_blank">Mahon tribunal</a> and the fallout associated with that and of course who could forget Phil Hogans amazingly <a title="1 Million yet to pay household charge" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0331/breaking1.html" target="_blank">well received Household charge</a>.

## I&#8217;m speaking at Dublinked

But that&#8217;s not the sort of news you want to hear is it? I thought not. I will be speaking alongside Martin Charlton, Richard Cantwell and Bruce Mc Cormack at an upcoming Dublinked Event &#8211; <a href="http://www.dublinked.ie/?q=DublinkedIRLOGI_SpatialDataEvent" target="_blank">&#8220;Dublinked- IRLOGI Spatial Data&#8221;</a>

I shall be chatting away about my experience of consuming the various open data sets that have been made available by the most wonderful folks in the Dublin Local authorities and of course the National Transport Authority. My experience had been building the <a href="http://urbanrural.herokapp.com" target="_blank">UrbanRural &#8211; built on heritage </a>web application to help you find your local built heritage without having to visit a myriad of organisations websites. The other piece I will be discussing is the mapping of the <a title="[OPEN DATA] NTA NaPTAN Mapped" href="{{site.baseurl}}/2011/12/open-data-nta-naptan-mapped/" target="_blank">NaPTAN data from the National Transport Authority which was made available on this very blog here.</a>

So if that sounds interesting to you or maybe you&#8217;d like to meet me in the flesh, AMAZING! You should come along on the <a title="Eventbright Page for Spatial DATA event" href="http://dublinkedirlogispatialdata.eventbrite.com/?ebtv=C" target="_blank">19th April @10:00 in Dun Laoghaire its FREE register your spot on the Event Page</a>
