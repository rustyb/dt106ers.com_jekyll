Ok this post is all about blowing off some steam about some of the flaws in the current implementation of the leap card system. Let&#8217;s put this way, i&#8217;m not entirely sure what&#8217;s the point in it being &#8220;live&#8221; when these issues are present, as I consider them pretty much fundamental to the the usability of the system. So instead of just venting on this here blog I decided I would pop off a nice construcive email to the folks at <a title="Leap Card Website" href="http://www.leapcard.ie" target="_blank">leapcard.ie</a> HQ.

Below is the email I sent this morning with added pictures for blogging posterity cus who likes to read just a bunch of text!

> Leap Card Feedback
> 
> My name is Colin Broderick and I&#8217;ve recently purchased a leap card and have been mostly satisfied with its ease of use on Dublin Bus and Luas services. However there are a number of issues which detract considerably from what can be a fantastic product and are as follows.
> 
> Your website (<a href="http://leapcard.ie/" target="_blank">leapcard.ie</a>) is not user friendly in that it&#8217;s navigation structure is very difficult to navigate, this is especially evident when you login to the &#8220;My account area&#8221;.
> 
> When one is logged in it is not immediately apparent what services are available. The only difference that is apparent upon staring at the screen for a number of minutes is two extra items on the left navigation bar. Clicking the manage my profile link on the right, brings you to a page where the main body has information which is irrelevant for the main purpose of being logged in, such as what is a Leapcard, newsletter signup and info on getting your Irish rail /Luas card as a leap.
> 
> <div id="attachment_1896" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 421px">
>   <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Leap_login_page.png"><img class=" wp-image-1896  " title="Leapcard.ie - logged in" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Leap_login_page.png" alt="" width="411" height="245" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
>     This is the screen you are presented with after login. Useless.
>   </p>
> </div>
> 
> It is not immediately apparent where one can view their Leapcard balance, this is hidden in a sub menu only available when you click manage my profile, which frankly does not link to any sort of profile management either. Another issue is that when signed in and one returns to the root page/main page (<a href="http://leapcard.ie/" target="_blank">leapcard.ie</a>) the extra navigation options are not present in the left nav bar.

>     This is the page you get when you click "Manage my Profile" after login

> 
> This can be simply remedied through the sign in redirecting to the accounts page such as a user/account dashboard showing total money spent through leap or monthly money spent alongside a current balance and possibly a list of last three journeys. Navigation links for the actions available during login should be moved to the right hand navigation, where the login box was.
> 
> I like the majority (some 68%) of the population in Dublin use the Dublin Bus service for my public transport needs, I live in north county Dublin near the airport and as such do not live nor work near a Luas stop or Irish rail station. As such I cannot check the balance of my leap card without registering online, where I believe the details in which must be provided are onerous (i.e. having to provide a date of birth and full address). And if one does not have a credit card or laser card you cannot complete a registration as bank details must be provided. I do not understand why there is no facility to simply query the balance of a card online?
> 
> Top Up online is not topping up online as far as I can make out. Similar to the last point, what&#8217;s the point of providing this facility when I still have to visit a Payzone outlet or a Luas or Irish rail station in order to &#8220;activate&#8221; my top up. You already have the money, it just defeats the purpose of online top up. Surely the balance can be disseminated throughout the card reader system, including those on the buses.
> 
> As regards, buying a Leapcard, I had no issues as I ordered it online and it arrived two days later with a nice information leaflet on how to use the card. However another family member of mine purchased their card at a Payzone location in the Dublin 9 area and only received a card with no information leaflet. Is a customer meant to only receive a card or are they to receive a card and information leaflet exactly like those ordered from <a href="http://leapcard.ie/" target="_blank">leapcard.ie</a>?
> 
> One final issue I have is as regards the woolly statements provided as regards future functionality specifically travel rebates, the wording only suggests that changing between modes will be rebated, such as changing from bus to Luas or Luas to Dart, etc. There is no mention of rebates for multiple journeys on bus, such as getting a bus to town from the south-side like the 14 and then changing to an airport bus like the 41. I assume since the system appears to be modelled on that of London&#8217;s Oyster card, will there be a flat rate Bus charge introduced instead of multiple fares with a rebate after like 5 journeys?
> 
> While I understand the leap card is in its infancy and there will be teething problems and issues to iron out, however I cannot understand how the product was released across the city without these services being fully functioning.
> 
> To end on a positive note I really like the leap card and really hats off to you for finally getting some semblance of a combined transport card out into the open for Dublin. I hope this can seen as constructive feedback.
> 
> Kind Regards
