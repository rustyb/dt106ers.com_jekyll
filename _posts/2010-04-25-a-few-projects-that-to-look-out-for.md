Right well i thought it was high time that I actually write a post myself for the first time in a long long time! This week i was introduced to a number of big regional projects from one of our lecturers, while some of the following may be fictional &#8211; they are definatly thought provoking and could provide ideas for what we might be able to achieve foe Dublin or any other city on the island.

## **1. The New York City HighLine**

[www.thehighline.org][1]

A number of years ago two New Yoker&#8217;s met at a community conference on what problems with the decaying elevated railway line above Manhattans west side. These two gents were, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, they hatched a plan and got massive amounts of city funding along with major community support through there highline NGO to convert this industrial marvel into an elevated city park for New York.

The park is 1.45-mile-long and 30 feet in the air. Only the first section is complete, work is under way to open the second half of the highline in 2011.



It is  a fascinating story to watch and i would urge everyone to go and check out all the videos on there website! Follow [@highlinenyc][2] on twitter!

## 2. SquintOpera

These guys are a bunch of visual artists that specialize in creating these fantastic videos for some of the worlds most high profile and successful architects, urban designers and engineers. They are just amazing to look at!







## Thats it for this week

I know i said there would be a few projects, but that all I have time to write about for today, I intend to continue with at least one post like this per week. I am aiming to sort one for around this time on a Sunday every week.
