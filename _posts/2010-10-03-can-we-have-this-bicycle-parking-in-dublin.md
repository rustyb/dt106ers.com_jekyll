I was on a recent inter rail trip around europe, something which i would highly recommend to anyone even remotely considering no matter what your age! But back to the point i witnessed some very interesting solutions to bicycle parking in cities, which i will show in some later short posts.

I thought that Switzerland would be one of those places where cycling would not be high on the agenda due to the fact that the place is well, not flat. But, i was totally wrong, there is so much cycling in switzerland. Not too sure what the breakdown of the mode share is but it has to be better than Ireland and Dublin considering the amount of bikes that are parked near the station in Bern here.

What i really would like to see is our Dublin railway stations with similar parking for bikes provided near them! There is no shortage of space generally on the footpaths around the stations similar to the picture above. Can it be done?
