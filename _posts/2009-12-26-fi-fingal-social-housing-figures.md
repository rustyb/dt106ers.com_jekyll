Written a few days ago but quiet interesting to get the figures none the less.

> AROUND 40% of Fingal County Council&#8217;s social housing waiting list is occupied by singleparent families, it has been revealed.
> 
> In response to a question from Cllr Kieran Dennison (FG), the council said that out of 6,691 families on the social housing waiting list, 2,720 were single parent families.
> 
> A further question from Cllr Dennison sought information on the nationality of the people on the local authority housing list.
> 
> In response to that question, the council revealed that just under half of its waiting list was occupied by Irish citizens (48%). Some 19% of the list was taken up by EU citizens and a further 33% were people from outside the EU.
