### <span style="font-weight: normal;">Dublin from a different perspective &#8211; the planning, architect, developer and politician</span>

<img class="alignleft" title="Redrawing Dublin" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs958.snc4/75190_161442317230885_159663910742059_264564_5285964_n.jpg" alt="Redrawing Dublin" width="720" height="502" />Was firing through the google reader when i came across this on [Buck Planning][1], Redrawing Dublin &#8211; Paul Kearns and Motti Ruimy, available for €33 in bookshops. (It&#8217;s sold out on amazon, will hopefully be able to get a copy in town today) Would suggest everyone check out the [Redrawing Dublin Facebook page ][2]for extra titt bits!

### Metro North or DART Underground, what&#8217;s it to be? One, both or neither&#8230;Dublin Transport.

Very good article in yesterdays [Sunday Times][3] by Richard Oakley, was quiet synical but a good laugh and hit the right nerve as far as the projects go. The RPA are definitely the better [PR machine at the moment][4]. Sticking with the transport note, now that Dublin Airports T2 is complete and operational, will the plans for a second parallel runway be lodged? Dublin Bus is to complete the role out of real time passenger information throughout the city by March, will have to see it to believe it! We are to finally have an integrated ticket this year at some stage! [Further Dublin Bikes expansion is on the cards too][5] and the new bike map looks like the shape of a seating plan for an airliner.

### Plans, plans and more plans!

This year however will undoubtly be the year for the preparation of the Local Area Plan, for instance Dublin City Counil have committed to producing 5 local area plans by the 2016 renewal date of the newly adopted plan.

Hope 2011 will be way better than 2010!
