I&#8217;m quiet a big fan of all the nice open data initiatives that are ongoing throughout our country and i&#8217;m really impressed with the much [larger effort in the uk][1].

When the [Fingal Open Data Hub][2] appeared on the map i thought sweet, i can go do something with their data but I really wasn&#8217;t sure at all, until now! Below are all planning applications in Fingal for the last 7 years. Thanks to the power of [Google Refine][3] and <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables</a> its now easier than ever to produce a map.



Little markers on the map is cool and all but you can also make heat maps! Unfortunately this is a rather limited feature in that you have to be zoomed out quiet far for it to work. When you zoom in the red hot spots never appear. See for yourself:  


This map has been filtered just to show those that have been decided and to discount those that were either invalid or withdrawn.

Unsuprisingly the areas with the highest concentration of applications are in the main residential areas of Swords, Blanchardstown and the Malahide/Howth area. It would be nice to be able to show only those applications that were granted outline permission or just were granted.

## What Next?

Well I have since discovered that if you go over to the [Dublinked website][4] the planning application register for the 5 Dublin county councils, although some are for members only. This is fantastic and I can&#8217;t wait to get stuck into that data to try and produce a dublin area map showing where the applications all were from year to year.

Unfortunately I hit a snag in that the Dublin City data is badly put together in that the data file is in a comma seperated format but for some reason in the description and the address fields there are commas which are not escaped therefore breaking the data structure when you import. I&#8217;ve emailed the lovely people in Maynooth about the problem, I&#8217;ve yet to receive a response.

**[UPDATE]** The Fingal Planning Application data from DubLinked has the decisions, the agents plus much more! Its taking a bit of time to get the details into fusion tables so I can map it fairly easily so stay tuned for an update.

## As always!
