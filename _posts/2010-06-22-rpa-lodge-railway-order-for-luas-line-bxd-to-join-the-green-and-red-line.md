I was reading the MetroHearald today on the bus and i noticed a public notice on page 11. I have scanned in a copy of the notice below for your viewing pleasure. (Click for full size) I hope the process is a speedy one. Public consultation starts on the 30th of June (next Wednesday). It will be great to see trams on O'Connell Street once again!
