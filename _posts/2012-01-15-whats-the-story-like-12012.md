It&#8217;s a new  year, its a new dawn and all that stuff and i need a job! Hello 2012, may you be a good one! Well kicked off the year with my first ever web application competition entry for the <a href="http://data.fingal.ie/Apps4Fingal/" target="_blank">#Apps4Fingal</a> competition. You may have see my entry, it&#8217;s <a title="Urban Rural" href="http://urbanrural.heroku.com" target="_blank">UrbanRural</a> and i&#8217;m going to give it a shameless plug below again. I would really love to win the competition!

I would also advise you to check out all the other entries, some fantastic ideas providing food for thought in the ideas section and some great apps!

## UrbanRural &#8211; Built on Heritage

Given that everyone seems to be mad into searching their family trees and establishing their personal histories, I figured why wouldn&#8217;t they be interested in their local area also. There&#8217;s a lot of built heritage out there that most people may never of known existed right in there back garden. UrbanRural aims to change that! I would be grateful if you could <a title="UrbanRural Entry" href="http://data.fingal.ie/Apps4Fingal/Apps/Name,35225,en.aspx" target="_blank">check out my entry and like it, spread the word, whatever!</a>

For those of you interested in transport may want to have a read of my undergraduate dissertation which is now available online at issuu. Long story short, it looks at the barriers that one would come up against establishing orbital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit" target="_blank">bus rapid transit</a> routes in Dublin.

## DT106ers is now on Google+

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1851" title="Plus one DT106ers!" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-15-at-01.54.40.png" alt="" width="972" height="529" />][2]So plus one us!

## Dublin Rail Transport &#8211; What it might be

Well the guys over at the <a title="Mental Planners" href="http://mentalplanners.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/future-of-rail-in-dublin/" target="_blank">Mental Planners have put together a nice map</a> of what the complete <a href="http://www.2030vision.ie/" target="_blank">NTA 2030 Vision transport strategy</a> would look like if all the rail projects are all implemented. It&#8217;s an interesting idea. I have mashed up their map with the population growth maps of the NTA strategy and the result is below. Interesting to note that while the strategy fails in many respects it actually deals with the growth areas by proposing rail projects quite well.
