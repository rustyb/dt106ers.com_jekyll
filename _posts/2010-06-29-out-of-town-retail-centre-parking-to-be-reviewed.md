> A GOVERNMENT review of retail planning guidelines will examine the desirability of allowing out-of-town retail centres to offer free parking for customers.  
> The question of introducing parking charges at shopping centres and retail parks is one of a number of key issues which will be examined by the review announced yesterday.
> 
> It will also examine the current cap of 3,500sq m for floorspace for retail units.
> 
> The Minister of State with responsibility for planning policy Ciarán Cuffe has said the review is needed to retain a balance and ensure there is an “even playing field” between historic city and town centres and large out-of-town centres.
> 
> Mr Cuffe has said that the current guidelines, though less than a decade old, may no longer be appropriate for a retail sector that has seen fundamental changes in recent years.<!--more-->
> 
> The Minister, a Green Party deputy, has also said he is in favour of curbing the proliferation of out-of-town retail units with no public transport links and which are totally car-dependent.
> 
> The basis for charging for parking at the centres would be to “level the playing pitch” by increasing the attractiveness of shopping in urban centres – where parking is seldom free.
> 
> Mr Cuffe has argued that the balance struck by the guidelines must allow fair competition but equally should also protect historic city, town and village centres.

> In the past 10 years there has been a substantial increase in large out-of-town retail centres close to roundabouts and major roads, which offer free parking to customers.
> 
> A departmental briefing document prepared for the review has suggested the typical location “may not make sufficient allowance for access by public transport”.
> 
> “Should edge-of-centre and out-of-town retail outlets be required to charge for onsite parking? If so, how should the revenue be used? Should it cross-subsidise public transport, to offset town centre parking costs?”
> 
> The paper also suggests that the recession may have driven developers to seek less expensive out-of-town locations for new retail centres. “At the same time, [it] has resulted in more vacant units in central locations, which may create the perception of urban decay.”
> 
> Organisations representing smaller independent and family-owned businesses – traditionally based in city and town centres – have argued that out-of-town retail centres have had an adverse effect on town centres.
> 
> The Competition Authority has taken the opposite view. It contended in a 2008 paper that the current retail planning guidelines may prevent more competition by imposing restrictions on the size and location of new grocery outlets.
> 
> That cap on the allowable floor space in retail centres will also be examined by the review. The current maximum grocery floorspace allowed is 3,500sq m.
> 
> However, the 2001 guidelines were amended in 2005 to allow the cap to be substantially increased for specialist large retail warehouses which required a large regional, or national, population catchment. The amendment was made specifically to allow Ikea to open a store in Dublin.
> 
> If the cap were to be relaxed for other types of retail development, large American multiples like WalMart might be attracted to locate in Ireland.
> 
> Between 2001 and 2006, there was a 66 per cent increase in the number of grocery stores run by multiples (such as Tesco, Dunnes and Aldi) and by affiliated retailers (such as SuperValu).
> 
> By contrast, there has been a 50 per cent decline in the number of independent retailers during the same period.
