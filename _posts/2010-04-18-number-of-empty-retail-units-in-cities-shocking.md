> **VACANCY RATES:** RETAIL VACANCY rates as a result of the economic recession are now running at 14 per cent nationally, but up to 20 per cent in Dublin and 25 per cent in Limerick, a planning consultant has said.
> 
> Richard Hamilton, of Urb Town Planning, described the higher figures as “shocking” – comparable to the depressed midlands and northeast of England – and said the “downward spiral” had to be reversed.
> 
> Addressing the Irish Planning Institute's annual conference in Tullamore, he highlighted the need to revitalise older inner suburban villages, saying they were all faced with the “Dalkey dilemma”.

> 
>   
> This related to the closure of traditional shops because of competition from supermarkets and their replacement by restaurants, takeaways, DVD rental stores and other outlets aimed at passing trade.
> 
> Mr Hamilton said it was clear that planning policies had not worked, there were “only one or two developers left”, the banks had no money and the local authorities were strapped for cash.
> 
> “Instead of waiting for Nama and the developers to come back in five years' time, we need to get out there and work from the ground up”, he said, citing the example of Marylebone High Street in London.
> 
> There, the Howard de Walden estate, which owns 70 per cent of the properties, took action to ensure that the diversity and character of the street were retained and enhanced by new retailers.
> 
> “Unfortunately, landlords here squeeze the life out of retailers in the short term as much as possible,” Mr Hamilton said.
> 
> He added that business improvement districts could work for towns, because they were “real places, compared to Facebook”. And while they were “resilient”, marketing was “fundamental” to success.
