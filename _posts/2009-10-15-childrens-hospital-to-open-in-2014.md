Not sure where the Eccles Street the site actually is, but i&#8217;m sure details will surface quiet quickly.

> The new Children&#8217;s Hospital of Ireland will open by the end of 2014, Taoiseach Brian Cowen has said.

> Construction of the €750 million project on a site beside the Mater hospital in Dublin will begin at end of next year, Mr Cowen told a press conference to announce the design team today.
> 
> The three existing children&#8217;s hospitals in the city, at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght, will be merged into the new entity, which will have up to 399 beds and 800 car parking spaces.
> 
> Mr Cowen insisted the amalgamation of the three hospitals was the logical step to take.
> 
> “It is quite clear that, in a city the size of Dublin, we do not need to have three children's hospitals,” the Taoiseach said. “This is no reflection on the work of the three hospitals whose services will combine to make up the new paediatric hospital.
> 
> “Indeed Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght have all worked with enormous dedication to serve the needs of our sickest children over many years. Their loyalty and commitment has been exemplary.”
> 
> Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney said the new hospital would provide the sick children of Ireland with a world-class facility. Merging the three existing hospitals would result in savings of €25 million a year, she said.
> 
> “There is no more important building in the health area than this project. It is a priority for funding and funding is provided in the capital plan,” Ms Harney said.
> 
> Funding for the project, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2011, will come from the Exchequer. An ambulatory and urgent care centre will also open at Tallaght Hospital in 2013.
> 
> Sick children will be accommodated in single rooms with space for parents to sleep over.
> 
> The Murray O&#8217;Laoire/Brian O&#8217;Connell/NBBJ consortium, which has extensive experience of building healthcare projects, has been selected as the preferred candidate to design the hospital on Eccles Street. Subject to planning permission, building will start next year and be completed by the end of 2013, with fitout continuing into 2014.
> 
> The chairman of Temple Street hospital Dr Frank Dolphin welcomed the “momentous” decision. He said the Government's commitment to building the new hospital during the current economic climate “sends an important message”.
