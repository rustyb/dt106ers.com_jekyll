> FACILITIES FOR houseboats; horse-drawn barges; markets; concerts; water sports, shops and restaurants are proposed for the Royal and Grand canals in Dublin in a new report from Waterways Ireland.
> 
> The *Dublin City Canals Study* recommends a range of recreation, tourism and commercial schemes to protect and improve the canals and open up both waterways to a greater range of uses.
> 
> The study focuses on the Dublin city sections of the canals within the curtilage of the M50, from Spencer Dock to Granard Bridge in Blanchardstown on the Royal Canal on the northside of the city, and from Grand Canal Dock to Blackhorse Bridge at Inchicore on the southside.
> 
> <!--more-->The study recommends the creation or improvement of walking and cycling facilities and an improvement in appearance and maintenance of all parts of the canals, but also makes specific proposals for each section of the canals as they progress through the city centre and suburbs.
> 
> On the Royal Canal, Spencer Dock is identified as having potential for berthing for boats, outdoor exhibits and waterside retail units. Moving out towards Sheriff Street, the study sees space to create a marina on the eastern side of the canal, along with lifting rail bridges to allow boat access.
> 
> Where the canal passes Croke Park, the development of pedestrian links to the stadium and its museum are recommended. When it reaches the back of Mountjoy prison, the development of a public plaza with space for concerts and markets linked to the proposed Mountjoy redevelopment is proposed. At the other side of Cross Guns Bridge, there could be potential for a water sports centre at the sixth lock.
> 
> The canal develops a “rural feeling” as it moves through Cabra, the study says, and the improvement and conservation of the natural amenity is the focus in this area. As it moves towards Ashtown, there is potential for an activity centre and a cafe and restaurant.
> 
> Between Ashtown and Blanchardstown at the twelfth lock, there could be a horse-drawn barge service between rail stations. On the Grand Canal, the main focus for commercial development is in the city basin where there may be the potential to moor houseboats, stage events like fireworks displays and concerts, and create a hub for watersports.
> 
> The area between Baggot Street and Portobello already has a reputation as a “little Venice” the study says.
> 
> This could be enhanced with a food or art market, an exhibition space at Portobello harbour and the possible development of a boutique canal boat hotel.
> 
> Further out towards Dolphin's Barn, Kilmainham and Inchicore, the recreation and amenity aspects of the canal are emphasised with proposals to develop parks and water sports.
> 
> The study acknowledges the structural problems along the canal, such as the construction of houses and industrial premises to the water's edge and concerns over safety and security. It accepts the proposals will require substantial public and private investment.
> 
> However, Minister for Community Affairs Pat Carey yesterday said the study would be instrumental in developing the canals.
