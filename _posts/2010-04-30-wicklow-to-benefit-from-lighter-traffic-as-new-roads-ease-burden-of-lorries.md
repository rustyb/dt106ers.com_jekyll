> TRAFFIC CONGESTION in Wicklow town is set to be reduced significantly following the opening yesterday of two new roads which will divert port-bound lorries from the town centre.
> 
> The 2.7 kilometre (1.8 miles) town relief road and the 1.6 kilometre port access road cost €65 million.
> 
> They involved the construction of a 130-metre (425ft) three-span bridge crossing the Broadlough estuary at the Murrough, another bridge crossing the Ashtown Stream, and two new railway bridges, at the Murrough and in Merrymeeting, Rathnew.

>   
> The new roads have been built to provide improved access and alternative routes into and around Wicklow town and to divert heavy port traffic from the town centre.
> 
> They are also intended to open lands for development around the town and port, pending a recovery of the economy, and to improve access to industrial lands in the port.
> 
> At the official opening yesterday, Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey said the people of Wicklow would benefit enormously from the roads through the reduction in town centre traffic.
> 
> They would also benefit because the roads themselves catered for vulnerable road users by providing footpaths, a cycleway and controlled crossing points at major junctions.
> 
> “This will encourage people to avail of a fast, healthy and environmentally friendly alternative to taking the car,” Mr Dempsey added.
> 
> “It will also contribute to safer journeys for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike, and is another step towards a sustainable transport future for Ireland.”
> 
> The town relief road links Ashtown Lane and Marlton Road with the Rathnew road, while the port access road runs from the Rathnew road towards the Murrough to link up with Leitrim Place.
> 
> Cathaoirleach of Wicklow County Council Pat Vance said an unexpected bonus was that the roads had opened up a vista of countryside and coast that would not previously have been visible to the road user.
