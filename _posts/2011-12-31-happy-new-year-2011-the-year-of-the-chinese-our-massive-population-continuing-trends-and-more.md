As 2011 draws to a close I thought we would look back on this bumper year for the blog and pick out the top 10 most viewed posts of 2011 as per the analytics. But first I would like to thank everyone who has commented or helped me out during the year, it is much appreciated and I wish you all the best in 2012!

## 13, 194 Hits in 2011

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1831" title="2011 Analytics" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-31-at-00.10.35.png" alt="2011 Analytics" width="421" height="247" />][2] That&#8217;s a 23% increase in traffic compared to the year before and I guess that reflected the at least 23% more effort I put in this year. Once again thanks a million to all of you who have read the blog, you&#8217;re great! Would be lovely if I could generate more debate in the comments though, that&#8217;s my new years resolution, to figure out how to do that!

So on we go to the top 10 posts of 2011.

## Top 10 posts of 2011

The most popular post of 2011 were wide and varied in their depth of content and the downright failure of Ireland in 2011 in terms of withdrawing from many capital (bog boys) projects. For now enjoy and let us hope 2012 will bring much more cheer in that department.
