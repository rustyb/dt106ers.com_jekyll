Having read the article in todays [Irish Times][1] (below) I it did not detail in anyway as to how [An Taisce][2] believed the decision by the Bord was &#8216;legally flawed&#8221;. A quick search of the An Taisce website provided the answer I was looking for:

> *“In many decisions in the past An Bord Pleanála has been a shining beacon.  However this latest decision represents a further nail in the coffin of proper Regulation in Ireland.  It highlights that poor planning, which was at the heart of Ireland's banking failure and consequent economic collapse, continues to be a major issue.  An Bord Pleanála is the independent body appointed to decide on major planning matters.  An Taisce believes that in this decision, the Board has failed to properly take account of the legislative requirements of the Habitats, Birds and Environmental Impact Assessment Directives and An Taisce detailed such issues in its substantial submissions made to the Board.  This grant of approval flies in the face of a number of European Court of Justice Rulings and indeed sets the Board up as contending it has more insight into the law than the Supreme Court of Ireland, on matters such as the integrity of Natura 2000 sites.”*  
> Chair of An Taisce Charles Stanley-Smith* &#8211; *[“Corrib Gas Pipeline Decision legally flawed” An Taisce][3]

Below the article as written by Lorna Siggins in the Irish Times today:

> AN TAISCE intends to seek a judicial review of An Bord Pleanála's approval for the final section of the Corrib gas pipeline.
> 
> The environmental organisation's chairman Charles Stanley-Smith believes the board's ruling last week was “legally flawed”, and may have “major implications for the status of implementing European directives in Ireland”, including the habitats directive.
> 
> An Taisce's view is supported by the Environmental Pillar of Social Partnership, involving a number of non-governmental organisations.
> 
> The board approved the final section of gas pipeline through a special area of conversation, Sruwadaccon estuary, with 58 conditions. The decision was welcomed by Shell EP Ireland, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (Ibec), the Pro-Gas Mayo Group and the Erris local contractors' association, involving businesses which have benefited from the project to date.
> 
> However, it was criticised by community group Pobal Chill Chomáin, Shell to Sea and An Taisce.
> 
> An Bord Pleanála inspector Martin Nolan said the new route plan would not put the public at risk, and would have a “remarkably light impact on the pristine environment of the area”.
> 
> Work cannot begin before issuing of a foreshore licence, and approval of consents under the Petroleum and Gas Acts, by the Ministers for the Environment and Energy respectively. Under planning legislation, groups have eight weeks to file a judicial review of the board's ruling.
> 
> Both the Environmental Pillar and Shell to Sea have expressed fears that such consents could be “fast-tracked” before the general election, due to the weekend resignations of Eamon Ryan and John Gormley, the two Green Party deputies holding these portfolios&#8230;.
> 
> The Irish Times

Although I am still not convinced that the Bord acted in a manner that was ultra vires to its powers. However only the judicial review and time will tell! Comments as always.
