I was using [@MarkLittle&#8217;s][1] new news website [Storyful.com][2], which i highly recommend you all take a look at it&#8217;s great! I came across this image recieved by Dundee University&#8217;s Satellite tracking station. It is very pretty. But look the sunny south east not covered in snow!
