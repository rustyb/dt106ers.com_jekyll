I&#8217;ve been a bit quiet on the blog over the last week, totally skimping on the resolution to write two posts a week minimum! However I have been a wee bit busy, compiling my complete Dublin Transport Map the work in progress shots can be seen over on the <a href="http://rustyswaffle.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblrverse</a>  
[<img class="alignnone" title="DTM " src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz6zamj8AC1qbzoeko1_1280.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&Expires=1329138635&Signature=o5burlofv5bNKdlkhlK66GcRtVo%3D" alt="" width="871" height="689" />][1]

### City Parks

Following on from the Public Realm Strategy submission by the greens, a friend of mine sent me on a link to a wonderful artcile by <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2006/10/paris-parks/ackerman-text" target="_blank">National Geographic on the public parks that adorn the streets of Paris</a>:

> <p style="text-align: center;">
>   <strong>Urban Downtime</strong><br /> The City of Light is also a city of green, with a panoply of parks and gardens where Parisians rest and rejuvenate.

### Wind Farms

The Guardian DATA Blog has again outdone itself by producing a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/06/wind-farm-map-mps" target="_blank">map of all the windfarms located within the UK</a>. I plan on taking their data and Irish Windfarms to the map, if anyone wants to help out that would be fantastic, just let me know via twitter or email.[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1928" title="Guardian DATA BLOG Wind Farms" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-12-at-13.14.13.png" alt="" width="804" height="448" />][2]

### Copenhagen

Copenhagenize this weeks carriers an interesting discussion on the new <a href="http://www.copenhagenize.com/2012/02/critical-mass-version-20.html" target="_blank">congestion ring being proposed to reduce the volumes of traffic in central copenhagen</a>

### Human Transit has arrived!

Finally, amazon got off there backside and shipped my copy of <a href="http://www.humantransit.org/" target="_blank">Jarrett Walker&#8217;s new book, Human Transit</a>. Initial impressions are its fantastic, certainly a comprehensive pocket guide for those interested in transport planning and how anyone can get involved in the debate and brush away the technical mumbo jumbo. I shall be writing a review of it in the coming weeks with any luck so, stay tuned!
