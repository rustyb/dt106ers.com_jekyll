> PLANS TO develop Spike Island in Cork Harbour as a major tourist attraction moved a step closer yesterday when an inaugural meeting was held of a special steering committee set up by Cork county manager Martin Riordan to develop the island.
> 
> Mr Riordan has said he hopes to open Spike Island to the public in 2010 through the provision of a ferry service, but the long-term hope is to develop the former prison into a major tourist attraction.
> 
> The Government transferred ownership of the island, including Fort Mitchel, which was used as a prison, from the Department of Justice to Cork County Council last July to enable the council explore the island's tourism potential.

> Speaking yesterday following the steering committee meeting, chairman Brendan Tuohy, a former secretary general of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, said he was hugely impressed by the enthusiasm for the project.
> 
> “There is huge enthusiasm for the project from the different agencies involved, who have all expressed their full support for the development of Spike Island. Over the coming months the process will seek the engagement of other interests in the Cork Harbour area.We are open to ideas and the views of interested parties will be taken on board. ”
> 
> He said the intention now was to advance the short and medium-term development of Spike Island as a tourism, heritage and recreational product in Cork Harbour.
> 
> A dedicated website has been established, and the public can contribute suggestions on the development. It can be accessed at www.spikeislandcork.com
> 
> The first known use of the 106-acre island was as a monastic settlement when a religious community was established on it in the 7th century. The first prison on the island dates from the 17th century following the end of the Cromwellian wars.
> 
> During the late 18th century and early 19th century it was used to hold prisoners to be transported to the West Indies and Australia, and during the 1850s John Mitchel (after whom the prison was renamed in 1938) was jailed on Spike for his involvement in the rebellion of 1848.
> 
> The island remained in British hands until July 1938, when the last British troops departed and the Tricolour was raised by Éamon de Valera. It was transferred to the Department of Justice in 1985, which operated a prison there until its closure in 2004.
