> The Republic's Planning Minister Ciaran Cuffe has blamed city and county managers for approving plans that have left hundreds of ‘ghost&#8217; estates dotted around the country.
> 
> In his first public speech since being appointed to office last month, Mr Cuffe also confirmed the Republic's ‘bad bank' NAMA would demolish unfinished homes in exceptional circumstances — but that the bill would be picked up by the developer.
