> 
> The very windy conditions last weekend resulted in an all-time peak wind output of 1064 MW on Saturday, generating enough power to supply the needs of 650,000 homes, according to EirGrid.
> 
> Wind output remained high throughout the day, with renewable energy at some times supplying 33 per cent of demand from electricity customers.
> 
> “This recent high level of wind generation shows the significant potential we have in Ireland to utilise this clean, green, indigenous fuel,” said Dermot Byrne, chief executive of EirGrid, the agency that operates the State's electricity transmission system.
> 
> “Ireland has ambitious renewable energy targets and the breaking of the 1,000 MW barrier for the first time is a significant step on the road to meeting them,” he added.
> 
> Ireland is reputed to have the best general wind resource in Europe and wind farms here have a higher average output than those on the continent. Currently, there are over 90 wind farms in operation which have the capacity to supply up to a maximum of 1,161 MW at optimum conditions.
> 
> In addition, Ireland has 238 MW of capacity from hydro stations in counties Cork, Dublin, Donegal and Clare and a further 58 MW of power capacity from landfill gas.
> 
> The Government wants 15 per cent of all electricity used in the Republic to be generated from renewable sources by next year.
