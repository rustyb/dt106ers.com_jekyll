  Dublin's first Park(ing) Day is happening this Friday 16<sup>th</sup> September from 10am to 4pm at various locations around the city.
</p>

Park(ing) Day transforms on-street car parking spaces into public open spaces for one day. Car parking spaces around the city – from Arbour Hill to Portobello and right through the city centre – will be converted into temporary public parks.

The purpose is to create awareness of sustainable travel and the need for more public open space in urban areas. It aims to promote healthy cities by engaging with the public through temporary art. Consistently the cities with the most liveable streets are rated as the best cities to live and do business in. Good quality public spaces also make people healthier and happier.

A diverse range of organisations and individuals (see list below) are volunteering to design unique installations that will each make its own statement in favour of more people-friendly streets.

Park(ing) Day is carried out according to an established code, within local bye-laws and in the spirit of awareness-raising through imaginative artistic intervention.

The event has become a global phenomenon since it started in San Francisco just a few years ago, with over 180 cities now taking part.
