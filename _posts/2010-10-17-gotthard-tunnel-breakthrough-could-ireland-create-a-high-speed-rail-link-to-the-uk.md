The longest tunnel in the world is now in Switzerland. This 57Km train tunnel, to be completed around 2017, at a cost to the tune of 930€ per person in Switzerland. Just for clarity that&#8217;s almost a 1,000€ for each and every one of its 7,593,500 citizens.  The video below shows the momentous occasion for the Swiss-Italian venture. The ethos behind this tunnel which is 14 years in the making is to reduce the amount of freight traffic on the alpine roads and to reduce the travel time to italy by over an hour.<!--more-->



Having read this and some recent news regarding [Deutsche Bahn gearing up for tests in the Channel Tunnel][1] in anticipation of starting services between London&#8217;s St Pancras International Terminal and Frankfurt and possibly onwards to Cologne. The route will be a direct competitor with the airlines on this high volume business route. This got me thinking&#8230;&#8230;

What if Ireland were to construct a tunnel or tunnel bridge combination in order to link us to the United Kingdom maybe across to Wales at some point from Waterford? Considering the distance between Dublin and London as the crow flies is approximately 470KM. Assuming that there would be various additions to the routing due to the terrain and such you could safely say the distance a train would have to travel would be some 600KM. Based on a train operating at the speeds [Deutsche Bahn ICE 3 trains][2] operate at (300KM/h) this journey could be completed in just over 2 hours. Which would be very competitive with the airlines in terms of over all time spent traveling.

Based on a quick investigation using google maps the shortest distance between Ireland and Wales stands at least 78Km in distance, across the open Irish Sea. But looking at the worlds longest bridge the Chinese have constructed a bridge with a total length of over 78km [Weinan Weihe Grand Bridge][3] is it not conceivable to construct such a bridge or a combined bridge tunnel design across the Irish Sea?

I understand it is a rather far fetched proposition and more than likely incredibly costly but if Dublin really is the back office for London and we really want to be connected to Europe and we no longer want to be at the mercy of Ryanair and the boys surely it could be made a reality!?
