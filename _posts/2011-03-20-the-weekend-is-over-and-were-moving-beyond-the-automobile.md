Yet another reading week, draws to a close and I still have not done much work but anywho I did find this little gem thanks to someone on twitter. The wonderful crew over at [streetfilms.org][1] have started to release their 10-part series [Moving Beyond the Automobile ][2] Here&#8217;s the low down courtesy of their blog post:

> Each Tuesday over the next ten weeks, tune in to Streetfilms as we&#8217;ll be posting a new chapter about smart and proven strategies to reduce traffic and improve street safety for all users.

The series will tackle a number of topics which  may be of interest to you including Congestion Pricing, Carpark Pricing and Transit orientated Development. However what got me most was they have produced a vid on **Bus Rapid Transit**. Big **THANKS** to the guys for this as it is providing the perfect intro to my thesis on a BRT orbital Network for Dublin! Check out the video below!
