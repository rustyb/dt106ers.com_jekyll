> Around €100 billion will be spent on developing wind-powered electricity generation off Irish and British coasts over the next 12 years, one industry figure predicted yesterday.
> 
> The plans are drawing multinational investors such as Mitsubishi and GE to Britain, but Ireland is not moving quickly enough to cash in on the job-creation opportunities that offshore wind offers.
