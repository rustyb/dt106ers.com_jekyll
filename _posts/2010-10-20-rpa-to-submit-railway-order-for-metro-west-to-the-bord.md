Well this pretty much snook in under the radar! I hadn&#8217;t heard a peep from this project, I assumed it was dead and buried for another time, how wrong was I!? Very happy to know i was wrong! From the RPA:

> The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has today (**20th October 2010**) announced its intention to apply to An Bord Pleanála for a Railway Order for Metro West, a light railway from Old Blessington Road, Tallaght to Dardistown, just south of Dublin Airport. The railway order, if granted, would permit RPA to construct, operate and maintain the Metro West light railway.
> 
> <!--more-->The proposed line begins at a new terminus in the median of Belgard Road adjacent to the Institute of Technology Tallaght. The line runs northwards over the Luas Red Line at Kilnamanagh/Belgard to Clondalkin and onwards to Quarryvale before crossing the River Liffey on a new bridge. The route continues to Porterstown and Blanchardstown, past the National Aquatic Centre and northwards to Cappoge and Meakstown before ending at a connection with Metro North at Dardistown. Full details of the proposed route, stops, Park &amp; Ride and other details are available 
> 
> [here][1] on this website.
> 
> The Metro West project is a key element of Transport 21, the governments transport investment framework and the railway order application represents a significant milestone in the delivery of the project. Metro West will link the large towns and districts in west Dublin such as Tallaght, Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Blanchardstown. With linked services between Metro North and Metro West it will also connect these towns with Swords, the city centre and all other locations along the route of Metro North.
> 
> Metro West will integrate with the wider transport network with interchanges with Luas, Irish Rail, Metro North, bus and QBCs, taxis and Park &amp; Ride along the route. The integration that Metro West will greatly improve connections within the entire public transport system.
> 
> The railway order application is the culmination of a number of years of planning, consultation, assessment and design work. The railway order includes plans and drawings of all the scheme infrastructure, legal documentation and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the scheme. These documents will be on display at the offices of South Dublin and Fingal County Council, Railway Procurement Agency and An Bord Pleanála from the 29th of October 2010 and also available to view and download from[www.dublinmetrowest.ie][2] from the same date.
> 
> Metro West will deliver substantial benefits to communities in west Dublin, providing a quality public transport system, employment opportunities during the construction and operation phases, regeneration potential and environmental improvement. Overall Metro West will enhance the quality of life for those who live, work and visit the area.
