I was reading a presentation today by <a title="Spatial Planning at TU Delft" href="http://spatialplanningtudelft.eu/" target="_blank">Robert Coco, Chair of Spatial Planning and Strategy at TU Delft</a>, on <a title="Slideshare Presentation" href="http://www.slideshare.net/robrocco/tools-for-research-in-areas-of-design-practice-problem-finding" target="_blank">presentation tools for research</a> in which he linked to a great video prepared by students as part of an urban mobility module within the school.

The group took a very visual approach by producing a video instead of the norm, a powerpoint presentation, which i must say was highly polished, well thought out and professionally done. The video begins with an introduction to Utrecht followed by an overview of the question being posed; Utrecht a place for knowledge? Then revealing a complete spatial analysis and possible interventions which could be made.

Importantly the video illustrates the issue with scale and viewpoint  you use when analyzing any urban area, something which I think can be lost in Ireland through the predominate focus on major national projects as opposed to smaller, more local interventions. The video refers to

> viewpoint and scale = resolution

I also believe this is very apt for Dublin given that we too are striving to be a knowledge city and looking to out compete other cities like Barcelona. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from the interventions proposed alongside how to better present how we came to these conclusions to the public.
