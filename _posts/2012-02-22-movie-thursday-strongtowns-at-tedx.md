This is a must watch for any spatial planner out there. We certainly really do need to take a long hard look at out urban environment and decide what are our priorities. So please take the few minutes to listen to what Chuck Marohn has to say, it&#8217;s well worth your time!

I believe Dublin is making some form of an effort, to at least make a plan to better utilise our public spaces within the city, so long as they actually follow through on a thorough implementation of the <a title="PDF" href="http://www.dublincity.ie/Planning/Documents/Draft_PRS_291111_web.pdf" target="_blank">public realm strategy</a>. Unfortunately more often than not many of the more recent housing developments in suburban areas have been lackluster in that many housing estates, just have flat piece of green with some shoddy planting (maybe even none at all). The kind of crap below, what is the function of that space other than, we didn&#8217;t build any houses on it? One plus is it doesn&#8217;t have a fence around it.
