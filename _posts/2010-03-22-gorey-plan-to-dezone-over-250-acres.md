Looking forward to reading the Draft Gorey Development Plan, a summary will be provided here at dt106ers.com.

> MORE THAN 250 acres of land zoned for residential or commercial development around Gorey, Co Wexford, in 2002 is to be &#8220;dezoned&#8221; under a new local area plan.
> 
> This is in line with advice that local authorities have received from the Department of the Environment that they should take account of new planning legislation, currently before the Oireachtas, that provides for more &#8220;sustainable&#8221; land use zoning.
> 
> The land proposed for dezoning under a plan adopted by councillors last Friday, includes 36 acres owned by the family of former Wexford county councillor Lorcan Allen (Fianna Fáil), adjoining the new Gorey bypass.
> 
> It was advertised for sale as a &#8220;superb development holding&#8221; in October 2006.
> 
> So much land was zoned for residential development in the 2002 plan that it could have accommodated a sixfold increase in the town&#8217;s population. Even then, up to 70 per cent of the new residents were coming from Dublin.
> 
> The population of Gorey has grown from about 4,500 a decade ago to nearly 8,000. It is home to the country&#8217;s largest second-level school, with over 1,600 students. A new second-level school has been approved and is scheduled to open in 2012.
> 
> The controversial 2002 plan was primarily promoted by Mr Allen and Michael D&#8217;Arcy (Fine Gael) and supported by councillors Joe Murphy (Fianna Fáil) and Deirdre Bolger (Fine Gael). Some of the land rezoned for residential development was owned by Ms Bolger&#8217;s husband&#8217;s firm, J Bolger and Co.
> 
> Mr Allen and Mr D&#8217;Arcy also sponsored the proposed rezoning of Gorey&#8217;s 11-acre showgrounds, of which they were both trustees at the time. But this proposal was overturned in response to public protests, led by dissident Fianna Fáil town councillor Malcolm Byrne.
> 
> Formerly the venue of the Gorey Agricultural Show, the land was given to the public by the Land Commission in 1937 for sporting and recreational uses. It has been acquired by Wexford County Council for the development of community and sporting facilities.
> 
> None of the four councillors involved in adopting the 2002 plan are still members of the council. Three of the new five-member Gorey district committee, which took the decisions to dezone land, were elected for the first time last year. They include Cllr Byrne.
> 
> &#8220;I would estimate that over a third of the new residential rezoning from 2002 has been removed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are still over 200 acres of land zoned as residential, all close to the town, and this is more than adequate to meet likely future needs this decade. It is, in my view, a much more balanced plan than that adopted in 2002. There is significant additional zoning for community and educational facilities and the main street is properly recognised as the social and economic heart of the town.
> 
> &#8220;I think that we have provided for very balanced and sustainable development of Gorey and will preserve the character of the town &#8211; although I have no doubt we will come under pressure from landowners to rezone in the coming weeks.&#8221;
> 
> The draft Gorey plan will go on public display within a fortnight.
> 
> A new development plan for nearby Courtown and Riverchapel is also being prepared.
