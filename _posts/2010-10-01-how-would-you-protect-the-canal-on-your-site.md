Based on our recent visit to our masterplan site, i figured that this little humpback bridge deserved its own little post just for how pretty it looks! I believe one of our major planning issues for the site is how to treat the royal canal and the tranquility of it!

Any suggestions on possible solutions is most welcome! Just drop a comment below.
