> A High Court judge has ruled that a stone quarry that has been operated near the shores of Lough Corrib in Co Galway since the 17th century requires planning permission.
> 
> Mr Justice Peter Charleton upheld Galway City Council's decision that quarry owner Michael O'Reilly must apply for planning permission and submit an environmental impact assessment (EIA) if works are to be allowed to continue there.
> 
> Mr O'Reilly brought High Court proceedings aimed at quashing the council's decision of October 11th, 2006 which required him to apply for planning permission.
> 
> Judge Charlton said he was satisfied the council had complied with section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. A further nine-month period is to be given to Mr O'Reilly to comply with the requirement before the council makes a final decision on whether to grant permission.
