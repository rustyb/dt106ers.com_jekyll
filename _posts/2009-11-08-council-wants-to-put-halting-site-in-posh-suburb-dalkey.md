> The rich and famous inhabitants of Dalkey in south Co Dublincould be hosting a halting site as well as major commercial development on their coastline if the local council gets its way.
> 
> Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown Co Council is proposing to zone the coastal area at Bullock Harbour in Dalkey &#8212; where Pat Kennylives &#8212; for commercial and residential development, and &#8216;traveller accommodation&#8217;.
> 
> The council &#8212; which recently caused controversy after allowing the demolition of the historic train terminal on Carlisle Pier in Dun Laoghaire Harbour &#8212; is proposing to re-zone Bullock Harbour, reversing a Green Party motion to protect the harbour as a heritage amenity.
> 
> The new proposal by the council would allow for major development on Pat Kenny&#8217;s doorstep, including advertising structures, hotels, offices, public house, commercial and residential development, retirement home &#8220;science- and technology-based industry&#8221;, a school or church as well as &#8216;travellers&#8217; accommodation&#8217;.
> 
> The proposal reverses a motion by former Green Party Councillor Gene Feighery in March this year and which was passed by the council, proposing the preservation of the harbour.
> 
> That motion also stated that any development in Bullock, the oldest working harbour in the country and first referred to in annals in 1152 when it was run by Cistercian monks, should be limited to open space and recreational activity.
> 
> Ms Feighery said yesterday: &#8220;This is absolutely astounding. The council adopted a motion before the last (local government) election. They all supported me then with an election coming up. Well, it&#8217;s five years away to an election and they are prepared to let this happen.&#8221;
> 
> The only concession between the council&#8217;s old proposals and the new one is that the new proposed zoning excludes a nightclub or disco.
> 
> The council is already involved in controversy over its decision to allow Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company to demolish the 150-year-old train terminal at Carlisle Pier which is now to be a car park. The old pier was the main exit point for Ireland&#8217;s emigrants and where many historic events have taken place.
> 
> An Taisce and Cairan Cuffe of the Green Party opposed the decision to allow the demolition of the railway station saying it was not, as claimed by the council and Harbour Company, &#8220;exempt&#8221; from planning permission, but without success.
> 
> However, Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown Co Council has now admitted that they may have &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; in relation to the decision.
> 
> The council said: &#8220;The initial view of the Planning Authority was that the proposed works were exempt and did not require a grant of planning permission. This view was communicated, in good faith, to Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company.
> 
> &#8220;However, on more detailed examination, following the lodgement of two Section five Declaration applications, the Planning Authority formed the view that there was, in fact, uncertainty in relation to the planning status of the works.
> 
> &#8220;Consequently, acting on planning advice, it was decided on October 6, 2009, to refer the matter for decision to An Bord Pleanala, under Section Five (Four) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. In these circumstances it was agreed not to issue a declaration on the two Section Five applications, but to await the decision of An Bord Pleanala.&#8221;
> 
> If An Bord Pleanala were to decide that the old train station was demolished without proper permission, the Harbour Company could be directed to reinstate it.
