> HOUSEHOLDERS face having to pay the cost of installing water meters in their homes when water charging is introduced in 2011.
> 
> Hard-pressed homeowners, already hit with a carbon tax and facing a property tax from 2011, may be forced to pay a standing charge on their water bill to recoup the cost of installing the meters.
> 
> Domestic water fees were abolished in 1997 but Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced in the Budget that charges would come back into force, probably from 2011.
> 
> However, how the scheme will work has yet to be decided.
> 
> The Government is considering the possibility of introducing the charge on a staggered basis, where some homeowners will pay before others as the system is rolled out.

> 
>   
> The total cost of implementing the scheme will be â‚¬600m over two years.
> 
> Some 1.1 million homes will have the meters installed, and 3,000 jobs will be created each year rolling out the system.
> 
> It is understood the contracts to install the meters will be tendered on a regional basis.
> 
> The Department of the Environment will spend â‚¬508m next year building water treatment plants, and yesterday Environment Minister John Gormley said that each household will be allocated a certain amount of water for &#8220;free&#8221;, after which consumption would be charged.
> 
> &#8220;Households will be allocated a free basic allowance, with charging only for water use in excess of this allowance,&#8221; Mr Gormley told the Dail.
> 
> &#8220;Metered charges are a common feature in nearly all developed countries and help to provide water users with an understanding of the economic value of what is becoming an increasingly expensive resource.&#8221;
