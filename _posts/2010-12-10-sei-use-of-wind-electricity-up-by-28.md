> The use of wind generated electricity in the Republic grew by 28 per cent on average, each year between 2005 and 2009, according to a new report from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.
> 
> According to the report *Energy in Ireland* overall renewable energy, which includes biomass such as wood chip boilers and biofuels for transport, grew by 15 per cent overall each year during the period.
> 
> The increase in the use of renewable energy sources, in addition to the decline in economic activity also resulted in a fall of energy-related CO2 emissions of more then 10 per cent in 2009.
> 
> Significantly the report also found the new vehicle registration tax and road tax systems had resulted in a dramatic increase in consumers choosing more fuel efficient vehicles in the A and B label bands. The report found some 80 per cent of new cars bought in the first 11 months of 2010 were A and B label vehicles up from 25 per cent prior to the new tax band introduction.
> 
> The report also shows that overall energy use declined by 9 per cent in 2009, with sectors such as industry at 13 per cent, services at 12 per cent and transport at 10 per cent witnessing the greatest fall.
> 
> Launching the report, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan said he was &#8220;encouraged&#8221; to see that &#8220;contrary to some perceptions, Ireland&#8217;s position in terms of energy prices relative to the rest of Europe continues to improve, with prices for many consumers now below the EU average.&#8221;
> 
> Minister Ryan added that by continuing to reduce energy wastage in homes and businesses, and by making much fuller use of natural energy resources, &#8220;we can dramatically improve our competitiveness, our energy security and reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices.&#8221;
