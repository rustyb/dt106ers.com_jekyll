I came across this website today [Qwiki][1] on the [visit Stockholm Facebook page][2] and decided to give it a whirl with some terms from the planning world. I was really impressed by it! It managed to pick up many of the keywords that form many definitions and strands of thought in planning such as rational actors (transport planning).

If you can get over the really annoying voice, it&#8217;s fantastic! Here is my selection below:

### Spatial Planning



### Transport Planning



### Rational Planning Model
