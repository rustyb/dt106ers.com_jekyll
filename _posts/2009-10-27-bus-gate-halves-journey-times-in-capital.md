</p>

<p>
  City traders claim the ban on cars using College Green in the morning and evening peak is killing business.
</p>

<p>
  But up to 90 million Dublin Bus passengers a year will experience a marked reduction in their commuting times if the system is allowed remain in place.
</p>

<p>
  New figures from Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann show journey times on all routes through the city centre have fallen since the bus gate opened.
</p>

<p>
  Before the bus gate it took an average of 20 minutes to travel from O&#8217;Connell Street to Nassau Street, with journey times of 35 minutes not uncommon. Now, it takes just 11 minutes &#8212; or 18 minutes in very heavy traffic.
</p>

<p>
  Dublin Bus also said that in September 2008, journeys through O&#8217;Connell Street, College Green and Dame Street in the morning peak took between three and 18 minutes to complete, with the average time almost 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  With the College Green Quality Bus Corridor &#8212; or bus gate &#8212; in place, journeys are now taking between two and ten minutes, with an average of five minutes.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;We have ten routes which all show the same thing,&#8221; a Dublin Bus spokesman said. &#8220;For bus passengers, it&#8217;s all about knowing the journey times. It&#8217;s an extremely important priority for us. The bus gate is not a high capital project, but it has had a major impact.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;It&#8217;s of huge strategic benefit. It has calmed the whole city centre and taken out the congestion that affects all road users. We carry 140 million passengers a year, and up to 90 million would be affected by this, and 40pc of all buses travel along that route.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  Bus Eireann also said it had seen a number of benefits for commuters including reduced journey times, more consistent operating times and improved reliability of the services in terms of arrival and departure times.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Feedback from customers on these services has been very positive about these benefits, which carry a large number of commuters in and out of the city every day to key population centres such as Ashbourne, Kells, Navan, Trim, Mullingar and Drogheda,&#8221; a spokesman for Dublin Bus said.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Improvements</strong>
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;In general, there have been improvements in running times of peak-time services of between five and 10 minutes on each departure, which has been greatly welcomed by customers,&#8221; he added.
</p>

<p>
  Cars are banned from using College Green from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday.
</p>

<p>
  Retailers have threatened to take a High Court case against the ban, claiming it is responsible for a loss of trade.
</p>

<p>
  Brown Thomas and Brown Thomas car park, Louis Copeland, Weirs, Q Park, Park Rite and Trinity Street car park have all threatened legal action, while the Dublin City Business Association claims that business is down 30pc because of the ban.
</p>

<p>
  It wants the ban lifted until next year, when a new bridge opens across the River Liffey which will be able to accommodate car traffic.
