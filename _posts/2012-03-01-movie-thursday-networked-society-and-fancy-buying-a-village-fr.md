Well its that time of the week again and we have two special films for you today, the first is an epic discussion by erricosson on networked society and their contributions to the Smarter Cities initiative. So sit back and enjoy some inspiration!

## Networked Society - Ericsson

> The documentary &#8216;Thinking Cities&#8217; deals with one of the most dramatic societal trends happening today: urbanization. The world population is expected to soar to more than 9 billion people by 2050, with roughly 70 percent living in cities. At the same time, Information Communications Technology (ICT) is extending its reach.
