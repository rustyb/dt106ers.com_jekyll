  Got my Dublin Bikes subscription card today, can&#8217;t wait to have a go on one of these bikes! This is the card you get below, the same size as your credit card:

  According to Dublin Bikes and the City Council the scheme is proving even more populour then they ever imagined it would be. I find it hard to believe why they did not put out more bikes in the first place. There are only 440 bikes for some 6000 people. But sure i can&#8217;t really comment as i havent had a chance to use one of the bikes yet.

  Can&#8217;t wait to get in there give them a go and be able to get over to <a title="Fallon &amp; Byrne" href="http://www.fallonandbyrne.com/" target="_blank">Fallon &amp;Byrne</a> for lunch in a jiffy, and back to college for the afternoon!

  In my opinion a scheme that will most certainly be a success! With any luck if the popularity of the service last they will expand it to other parts of the city.  I also don&#8217;t believe we will see any of these bikes in the Liffy, but only time will tell!
