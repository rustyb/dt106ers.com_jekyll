>   DEVELOPER Bernard McNamara is being personally sued for €96m by clients of Davy Stockbrokers over the now infamous purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle Site.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   Mr McNamara, who last week launched a €140m action against the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) over the terms of the mammoth property deal, one of the largest in Irish history, will &#8220;vigorously defend&#8221; the action.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   Three years ago, a consortium headed by Mr McNamara, financier Derek Quinlan, the DDDA and a group of investors headed by Davy paid €412m for the 25-acre site in Ringsend on the south side of the Liffey, in Dublin. It is now valued at an estimated €60m.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   Davy&#8217;s action, on behalf of private clients who loaned funds to the builder to invest in the site, has been lodged against Donatex, a McNamara company and a shareholder in Becbay, the company that ended up buying the land.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   The legal action is also against Mr McNamara in a personal capacity &#8212; on the grounds that he provided a personal guarantee on the initial funds that private investors provided to fund his own investment.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   The litigation is the single largest personal-guarantee action to seek entry in the Commercial Court and comes as the court prepares to deal with an anticipated wave of litigation arising from various tax-break schemes extended to the hotel and nursing home sectors. Davy investors will seek access to Ireland&#8217;s fast-track Commercial Court list on Monday morning.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   The sum sought by Davy&#8217;s clients, the Channel Islands-based Ringsend Property Limited, dwarfs the €60m summary judgment order being sought personally against developer Liam Carroll by the Irish Nationwide Building Society.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   It also exceeds the recent judgment secured by Anglo Irish Bank against troubled hotelier Hugh O&#8217;Regan for €37.5m &#8212; for personal borrowings and guarantees.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   That was the largest recorded judgment to date against an individual in Ireland.

>   Exposure

> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   Mr O&#8217;Regan will again come before the Commercial Court on Monday, where he is being personally sued for another €35m by Anglo on foot of personal guarantees provided to secure bank finance for his Morrison co-ownership.
> </p>
> 
> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px;">
>   Developer Paddy Kelly and Patrick Dunning, who operated Dublin&#8217;s boutique hotel, The Morrison, along with Mr O&#8217;Regan, are also being sued by Anglo although the extent of the personal exposure claimed in relation to the two men is said to be less than €4m.
