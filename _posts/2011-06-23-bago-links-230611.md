So to ease myself back into the grand scheme of things I shall just be dropping a few links.

To kick it off the[ Strong Towns Blog][2] have been running a series of posts on suburbanization in the US:

The Growth Ponzi Scheme

*   Day 1: <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/13/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-1.html" target="_blank">The Mechanisms of Growth &#8211; Trading near-term cash for long-term obligations.</a>

*   Day 2: <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/14/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-2.html" target="_blank">Case studies that show how our places do not create, but destroy, our wealth.</a>

*   Day 3: <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/15/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-3.html" target="_blank">The Ponzi scheme revealed &#8211; How new development is used to pay for old development.</a>

*   Day 4: <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/16/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-4.html" target="_blank">How we&#8217;ve sustained the unsustainable by going &#8220;all in&#8221; on the suburban pattern of development.</a>

*   Day 5: <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/16/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-5-finale.html" target="_blank">Responses that are rational and responses that are irrational.</a>

The [TransportPolitic][3] has a great post on the [MASSIVE Paris metro expansion plans][4]

Dublin Bus announced its plans for the [Swords / Santry / Rathfarnham / Terenure area][5] as part of Network Direct with some interesting route choices and very high frequencies.

The RPA has on the charm offensive with its promotion of [Metro North on the facebook page][6]

[Ireland after NAMA][7] has an obscure piece on the [GAA and its tracking of players migrating from club to club][8]

## Last but not least

To round off the mixed bag of links check out the [Mapping London Blog][9] for a cool [visualization of foot traffic through Londons tube stations][10].
