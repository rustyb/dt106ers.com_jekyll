According to the UN today, we symbolically reached the <a href="http://www.7billionactions.org/data" target="_blank">7 Billion person mark</a>. It just boggle the mind, that in just 11 short years since 2000 that another billion people have been added to the worlds population. So why not tell your story on <a href="http://www.7billionactions.org/" target="_blank">7 Billion Actions</a>?

In 1900 some 10% of people lived in cities, by 2007 this was 50% and it is predicted by 2050 some **75% will be living in cities**!

That will produce some profound impacts on land use planning for the future. How are we going to deal with this 25% increase in just 40 years? Our own population <a href="http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Commentary%20part%201.pdf" target="_blank">grew by 14.5% between 2002 &#8211; 2011</a>, and we are only a small drop in the ocean.

Considering Ireland went with the <a title="National Spatial Strategy" href="http://irishspatialstrategy.ie/" target="_blank">spread it everywhere spatial approach</a> and yet the majority of population growth continued in the City areas such as Dublin and Cork:

[<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1731" title="Census 2011 Population Change" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Commentary-part-1_Page_5-719x1024.jpg" alt="" width="431" height="614" />][1]

So why don&#8217;t we just abandon the politically motivated spread it everywhere and start to prioritize areas for investment and development? After all that&#8217;s what land use planners are meant to do right? Think Big, Think Strategic!

So anyone got any pragmatic solution to deal with this? Would love to hear from you if you do!
