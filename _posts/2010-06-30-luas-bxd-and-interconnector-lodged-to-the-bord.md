Today the 30th of June 2010 is the day that the Luas Line BXD, Stephens green to Broomsbridge website goes live. All the documents pertaining to the railway order are available freely at: <a href="http://www.dublinluasbroombridge.ie/" target="_blank">www.dublinluasbroombridge.ie</a> It is also the day that CIE have lodged their plans for the Dublin DART interconnector to link the Kildare Line and with Docklands opening up northern rail service to the south. Document's for this railway order can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.dartundergroundrailwayorder.ie/" target="_blank">www.dartundergroundrailwayorder.ie/</a><!--more-->

It's a great day because finally the clock can start ticking down to the realisation of many years of dreaming and wishing by the citizens of Dublin for the trams that once crossed the Liffey to be finally reinstated! We are one step closer to actually having a piece of a viable rail system in the capital, one where the rail nodes actually will join up from day one! That's right I'm talking about the possibility of being able to get a Luas or a Dart or a Metro all from the same station, all going different places!

More than likely based on previous strategic infrastructure applications for railway orders, the three projects could be with An Bord Pleanala, accounting for further information request and oral hearings at least 12 months if not longer.

My worry is that there will be no coordinated approach regarding the construction of the three projects that's; Metro North, LUAS line BXD and DART interconnector, even though two of the projects will be pursued by the same agency.  As far as I know combined they will take something like 6 years to complete all the projects with a layoff in the works for the first 6 months of 2016 for the Rising celebrations.

I have one other gripe for the construction is the probability that the pond in St Stephens green will be drained for the duration of the construction works for the stations at St Stephens Green.
