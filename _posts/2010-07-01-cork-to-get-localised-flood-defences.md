> NEW MEASURES to reduce the risk of flooding in Cork city could be in place within 18 months, according to Cork city manager Joe Gavin, following confirmation that the OPW is to appoint consultants to oversee the project.
> 
> Mr Gavin confirmed the OPW had opted for localised flood defences on the Lee upstream of Cork city which would allow the ESB to discharge higher volumes of water from Inniscarra dam without causing flooding in the city centre.
> 
> He said the proposal, which involves localised work and changes to the ESB operating regime, was less costly and more easily implemented than another proposal which involved building tidal barriers and raising quay walls which would cost €145 million and take several years.
> 
> <!--more-->
> 
> Details of the proposal were set out in the Draft Lee Catchment Flood-Risk Management Plan which was drawn up by the OPW following the November 2009 flood and which was presented by Mr Gavin to members of Cork City Council this week.
> 
> Mr Gavin said under the localised proposal consultants would be appointed by the OPW to identify areas upstream of the city where work needed to be carried out to enable the ESB to release water at higher volumes without causing flooding.
> 
> He said the project would also examine quay walls and bridges in the city where flood waters from the Lee could spill into the city centre.
> 
> “This scheme is less costly than the other option and can also be introduced more quickly – consultants are going to be appointed and I believe that it could be in place within 18 months because much of the work relates to management procedures at the ESB dams.”
> 
> An ESB spokeswoman confirmed that the company had been working with the OPW on the Lee flood-risk and management study.
