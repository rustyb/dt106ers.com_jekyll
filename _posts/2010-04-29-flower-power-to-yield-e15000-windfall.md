> FARMERS ARE to receive Government payments of up to €15,000 annually for producing wild, rare flowers such as the Mountain Aven and the Spring Gentian.
> 
> Described as a “unique” scheme yesterday by Burren Irish Farmers' Association chairman Michael Davoren, the plan is part of a joint €4 million Department of Agriculture and Department of the Environment initiative aimed at conserving the biodiversity of the Burren, Co Clare.
> 
> The model has been developed over the past five years in a pilot programme by BurrenLife across 20 farms in the area and is now to be rolled out across 100 Burren farms over the next three years.
> 
> Minister for Agriculture Brendan Smith has confirmed that €3 million will be made in direct payments to farmers over three years. Moreover, Minister for the Environment John Gormley has said his department is to spend €1 million overseeing the work.
> 
> The project director with BurrenLife, Dr Brendan Dunford, said that “one of the pioneering aspects to the programme is that farmers are going to be paid for producing species-rich grassland and that will determine the level of payment to them”.
> 
> Dr Dunford cited Mountain Avens, Spring Gentians and orchids as examples of flowers that make up species-rich grassland in the Burren.
> 
> Mr Davoren said Burren farmers were responding to the market where there is now a demand for “species-rich grassland and a pristine environment”.
> 
> “The only way we can earn a living is by looking after the environment. It is a totally new concept and we will embrace it,” he said. “There will be a plan for every field and for every farm.”
> 
> Dr Dunford said the programme would have a “tremendous impact” on the Burren landscape.
> 
> In the scheme, farmers are to be graded on a zero to 10 basis with only fields having a score more than four becoming eligible for payments. Farmers who score 10 can expect to receive a payment of €100 per hectare per annum for the first 40 hectares. Farmers will also receive payments for carrying out capital works and for protection of EU protected designated lands. Closing date for applications to participate in the scheme is May 17th.
