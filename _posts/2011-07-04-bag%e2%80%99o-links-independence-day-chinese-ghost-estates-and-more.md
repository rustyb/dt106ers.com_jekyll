Well folks since it will be independence day by the time I publish this post Happy America day folks and for those in Canada belated Canada Day! That crap aside down to business, been some great links this week!

**Chinese ghost estates (cough) CITIES!**

Interesting piece by those plucky Aussies on dateline down under &#8211; [Watch Chinas Ghost Cities][1].Watch as they tour cities designed for 12 million people which are 85% vacant. Boggles the mind!

**News just in, An Taisce hates planners!**

While they also hate the laws in which we operate in, councilors and county managers they label planners as &#8220;spineless&#8221; in the face of bad zonings. [Read On][2]**.**

**Fingal talk to NIRSA summer school of urban walkability study**

Fingal planners were on hand at the National Institute of Regional Spatial Research&#8217;s summer school to explain there study of walkability in the Blanchardstown area, a residential area i know only too well characterized by a huge shopping centre and loads of fences to stop you walking to the bus 50m&#8217;s away.  [Read On.][3]

**Preliminary Census Results are out!**

Results from the 2011 census of Ireland have been published, check out the published [CSO Report [PDF]][4] or [check out the data][5]. There have been a number good posts from various blogs who were pretty fast off the mark. One very good one by Rob Kitchin over on [Ireland After NAMA with commentary on the vacancy rates][6]. Most eye catching stat for me though is , there are way more women than men in the state, well except for the midlands.
