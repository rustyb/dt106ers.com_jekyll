> Landfill levy will increase to €30 per tonne, incineration levy will be €20-€38 per tonne; root and branch review of waste policy will benefit the environment and drive job creation, says Green Leader
> 
> Green Party Leader and Environment Minister John Gormley today launched a report underpinning a major review of waste management policy. The report commissioned by the Minister on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, examines all aspects of waste management policy, from prevention and minimisation to the management of residual waste.
> 
> Speaking at the launch, the Minister said: “I was determined that our review of waste management should be a root and branch one, and it is. The Eunomia report provides a blueprint for change. Changing the way we collect and treat our waste will benefit not just our environment, but also our economy. It will create jobs in new waste industries. It will enhance competitiveness of the wider economy as a whole. It will drive innovation which in turn will drive job creation.”
> 
> The Minister also announced increases to the landfill levy to drive waste from landfill in order to meet challenging EU targets, the first of which occurs in 2010. The levy will increase to €30 per tonne by 2010, to €50 in 2011 and to €75 in 2012. “Earlier this year the Government also decided to introduce an incineration levy. While the actual rate of the levy will need to relate to the rates of landfill levy which I have just announced I do envisage that the incineration levy will be in the range of €20 to €38 per tonne,” said the Minister.

> Minister Gormley stated that he would shortly be bringing a new policy statement to Government with a view to its publication in the New Year. The Minister concluded: “The Eunomia report represents a launch pad for transforming how we deal with waste in Ireland. We now have the considered research which is the essential foundation for good and robust policy. We have the blueprint for legislative, institutional, regulatory and organisational change to achieve a wholly sustainable approach to waste management.”
> 
> The Programme for Government agreed in 2007 included a number of objectives relating to waste management among them a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions of such a review.  
> In February 2008, a procurement process was initiated to appoint consultants to undertake a comprehensive study on the waste sector, to underpin the overall review, and to cover a wide range of issues to help identify how best to proceed with further efforts to reduce waste levels, improve recycling rates and deliver equitable and cost-effective waste management solutions. Eunomia Research and Consulting Ltd. (and partners) were selected to undertake the study.
> 
> The report has compiled by a group of Irish and international consultants led by Dr. Dominic Hogg of Eunomia Research and Consulting. The Minister paid tribute to the work done in compiling such a comprehensive study by Dr. Hogg and his Irish and international associates.
