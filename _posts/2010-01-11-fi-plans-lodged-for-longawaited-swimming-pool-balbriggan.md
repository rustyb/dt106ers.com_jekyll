A new six lane 25m pool for north county Dublin.  A shame though that the pool design appears not to be a full length &#8220;deep&#8221; pool, its a pity it isn&#8217;t because it could have been used as a competition pool. Enough about non planning matters.

Since this article was written there has been 2 further submissions objecting to the proposed leisure centre development. The grounds for there rejection can be summarized as follows:

1.  Issues in realtion to direct overlooking of there properties from the bar/lounge area of the proposed development.
2.  Noise issues in relation to the associated plant required for the operation of a swimming pool.
3.  Noise issues in relation to the increased traffic that will be created by the new development.
4.  The size of the members bar/lounge.
5.  Issues in realtion to the drainage of the site and the potential for disruption of the drainage on their own lands due to the proposed construction of an attenuation pond for storm drainage.
6.  Issues in relation to Water Supply in the local area being disrupted due to the large volumes of water needed for the operation of a swimming pool.

> BALBRIGGAN Rugby Club and Swimworld Investments are awaiting a decision from Fingal County Council on planning permission for the long-awaited swimming pool development at the club grounds. Swimwor ld Investments (formerly Kingfisher), have combined with the club to apply for planning permission for the facility before Christmas and as the New Year breaks, the developers are hoping for a green light from developers.
> 
> So far, only one submission from the public has raised concerns about the development. Neighbours of the site, Eamonn and Phyllis Carew want reassurances that measures will be taken to avoid increasing the risk of flooding on their property, if the development goes ahead.

> The couple&#8217;s submission to the planning file, states: &#8216;While we would mostly welcome such an amenity to the local area we are very concerned about the increased flooding risk this could cause for our family home.&#8217; The couple believe that extensive work needs to be done to the Bracken River to improve drainage in the area and that this should be a condition of the project&#8217;s planning permission.
> 
> There is written consent and support for the development on the file from Balbriggan Rugby Club who have backed the idea from the beginning.
> 
> Should the project win the approval of planners, there is a € 3.4 million grant in the pipeline to support it. That money was controversially moved from a proposed swimming pool project in Skerries.
> 
> Balbriggan Rugby Club hopes the swimming pool will be up and running and open for business within a year of planning permission being granted and said it will be a positive development for the whole area. The development will create jobs in the construction phase and around 35 people will be employed in the operation of the facility, a welcome local boost for jobs.
> 
> Although the pool is a commercial exercise, Fingal County Council has secured between 60 to 70 hours of community access to the facility per week.
