A few weeks into my internship at the planning appeals board, [Bord Pleanala][1], there&#8217;s no better time to throw up a quick post about life in the board. It&#8217;s an interesting place to work with such mad amounts of expertise flowing about the place but very quiet as most of the inspectors are mobile and working on site. But what about the view from the top? I hear you say.

It&#8217;s pretty decent if i do say so myself, from the fifth floor (the board room level) you&#8217;ve got panoramic views of the city. Below is a taster view looking to the Northside. The bottom of North Great Georges street is cut off though, due to my amazing photography skills! One day we saw David Norris strolling down the street and yes you can hear his booming voice 5 stories up!
