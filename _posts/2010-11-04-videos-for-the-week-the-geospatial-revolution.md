<a title="GeoSpatila Revolution Website" href="http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/" target="_blank">The GeoSpatial Revolution</a> is amazing! I cannot reccommend these videos more highly, 15 minutes of pur excitement of the possiblities of higher integration of GIS systesms into public service delivery and empowerment of citzens.

I am very fond of the second episode where it showcases the work of [The Food Trust][1] an organisation fightting to reintroduce urban supermarkets in order to comabt childhood obesity.

Also of note are the amazing applications created by the [City of Portland][2], who are empowering there citzens to report potholes and graffetti along with a host of other things.
