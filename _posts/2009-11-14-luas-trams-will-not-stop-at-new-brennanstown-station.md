>   However, although a stop is being built at Brennanstown, off the N11 near Cabinteely, Luas trams will not stop there. New housing developments in the area had been and are being marketed on the basis of proximity to the Luas stop.

>   Fine Gael TD George Lee said the decision not to stop at the station would be a “a kick in the teeth” for local residents.

> <p style="line-height: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px;">
>   “This will come as a major shock to local residents, many of whom bought apartments and houses in the area at the height of the boom in the expectation that they would have a Luas stop on their doorstep in the near future.

>   “These are the same people who are suffering terribly from negative equity,” Mr Lee added. “Plans to deprive them of a Luas service is like kicking them when they are down.”

> 
> <p style="line-height: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px;">
>   He said he understood the Rail Procurement Agency was concerned that the demand for a Luas service would not be sufficient due to the number of empty apartments in the area.

> <p style="line-height: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px;">
