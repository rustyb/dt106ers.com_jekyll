The week in planning this week saw some exciting large projects biting the dust and some rising from the ashes:

### Incinerators

[Indaver Ireland are pursuing a Judicial review of the Bord Pleanala decision][1] to refuse permission for the planned Waster to Energy facility (Incinerator) at Ringaskiddy on the a number of grounds including strangely that the board made conclusive decision prior to the completion of an EIS

### Merging

The talk of merging local authorities continues, this week minister Hogan announced that [Tipperary North and South county councils are to be merged for the 2014 local elections][2]. This along with the merging of Limerick county and city reduces the number of LA&#8217;s by 2.

###  Transport

Fantastic piece by Jarret Walker over at HumanTransit.org on how a transport planner might approach the [designing a transit network for high ridership in a dense city. His example Halifax, Nova Scotia.][3][<img class="alignnone" title="One-way loops - Halifax" src="http://urbanist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454714d69e2015433a3f782970c-800wi" alt="" width="560" height="274" />][3]

### Network Direct

Our own network reshuffle / redesign continues apace with Dublin Bus releasing revised proposals for the last areas of the Network Direct Phase II to be implemented in the Autumn (whenever that is!). The most important for me is the Santry area as thats where I live:

Just to recap the two areas realeased are:

*   [Swords / Santry / Rathfarnham / Firhouse / Ballycullen / Terenure][5] - Route Diagram [[HERE]][6]
*   [Ballinteer / Dundrum / Milltown / Ranelagh / Beaumont][7] - Route Diagram[ [HERE]][8]

###  DIT Grangegorman Planning Scheme

The long awaited restructuring of DIT and its spread out buildings has made some progress this week. It has been adopted through a variation into the Dublin City Development Plan 2011 &#8211; 2017 with one final hurdle to overcome being the probable appeal of the scheme to Bord Pleanala by some local interest groups. Details of the plan can be found at [www.ggda.ie][9] and [www.dublincity.ie][10]
